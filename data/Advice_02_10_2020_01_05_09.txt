I have my employee review coming up and this one is the one that really counts as it's the last quarter review for last year and determines raises etc. The only thing is they give us goals we then have to bring examples of how we achieved those goals, and this time around I unfortunately can't think of anything or have any examples because last time I had some pretty good ideas and examples, but I've been doing those exact same things, and haven't really been doing any better or worse! I also have lost alot of my motivation for the place as time has gone on, because for example one of the goals is how we came up with procedural improvements to make things more efficient, well any ideas I've had and brought up, all fall on deaf ears! I've also come to learn that alot of employee training and seminars they give us, it's all blowing smoke up our ass and teaches us about speaking up and how we are all valued bla bla bla but when it comes time to implement any of that stuff at work they don't really mean it! And alot of things I've witnessed over the the last year has proven to me this company doesn't actually stick to the values it's trying to promote, I tryed to speak up about something once that I didn't understand what was an issue, I then had to be coached on how to sit down and just shut up pretty much, so exact opposite of what they lead us to believe and my issue was still never resolved. But I just smiled and nodded and pretended like I valued the "advice", because I need to stay in this job for a little bit as I am hoping to switch departments as there is still alot of learning and skills I can develop from this company, and maybe going to a new building they actually follow the values. I am also behind on a couple projects, but I've been diagnosed ADD so I have asked for an accommodation in order to get these things done but again fallen on deaf years, and I know it will be brought up on the review why I haven't completed these assignments, but I know if I try to explain they just see it as bad time management etc, and I feel like if I call them out for not giving me the accomodation that was discussed in the past, I still won't be heard or taken seriously! So please help me come up with the stuff I can say in this review, I need to make it seem like I do care about this job and that I am trying to improve so I can switch departments I am just sick of the role I am in and the boring mundane tasks and ready to move on!
