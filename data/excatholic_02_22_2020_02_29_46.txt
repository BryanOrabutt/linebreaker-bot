(If you haven’t heard about this, you can learn about it [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kiro7.com/news/local/kennedy-catholic-students-walk-out-protest-after-they-say-two-openly-gay-teachers-were-forced-out/K26BEIW6UVG4VDRTZCRYSTTK3M/%3foutputType=amp) and [here](https://www.kuow.org/stories/archdiocese-called-for-gay-teacher-resignations)). I didn’t go to Kennedy but I went to 3 different Seattle archdiocese Catholic schools for 13 years and they're all so full of shit. They all love to talk about how much they're committed to social justice but then do shit like this. Seattle is known for being a liberal and left-leaning area, but the Seattle archdiocese is extremely conservative. Around here, the political and social views of the Catholic Church and archdiocese often clash with the popular views of the actual people. In 2014, Eastside Catholic High School (also in the greater Seattle area) [fired their vice principal for being gay](https://www.kiro7.com/news/gay-vice-principal-confronted-400-local-students-w/246198845/) and marrying his partner and it sparked national outrage. Sister Mary Tracy (SNJM), who was the head of school who fired him, ended up having to [resign](https://www.issaquahreporter.com/news/president-of-eastside-catholic-school-resigns-sister-mary-tracy-leaves-amid-controversy-over-vice-principals-firing/) and then shit calmed down. Peter Sartain, the previous archbishop, resigned a few months ago because he's been a pretty ineffective leader and the whole Eastside Catholic debacle was definitely part of it (also the uncovering of the pedophile priest scandal in Seattle). A lot of people are also outraged by this whole thing at Kennedy and I hope it actually leads to some real change this time. There was a protest on Tuesday (2/18) that the school allowed to happen, but then they made students take down signs they hung up on the walls. The Catholic schools in the Seattle archdiocese (including the ones I attended) make all their employees sign a morality contract, and a lot of people are starting to talk about how ridiculous that is. The worst part about all of this is the message it sends to all LGBTQ+ students and employees at Catholic schools. They are telling us that we do not belong and they do not respect or support us. The archdiocese has banned all Catholic schools under their authority from having GSAs or any sort of LGBTQ+ club or student union. They also make  schools teach Catholic religion books that say terrible and false things about homosexuality and transgender people and push the Church's staunchly conservative political agenda. Tl;dr this is nothing new for Catholic schools in the Seattle area but more and more people are getting pissed and I hope things actually change this time.
