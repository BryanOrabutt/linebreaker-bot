I feel hurt that you didn’t want to see me in person. I feel hurt that you wanted to see other people. But you were the only person so far in my life that even in the slightest cared about me. That’s why I feel like I can’t let go. Because I never had anyone else. It’s so sad that you had to be the best thing yet you treated me so horribly. It feels so toxic. The way your friends treated me too. I never felt included. The way you left me feels like you’ll only remember me the way you remember a friend in 6th grade. It’s a distant memory to you but to me it was something that still resonates. I miss you everyday and I want to text you but I know that I’ll get a cold response or no response at all. I feel lost without you. It seemed like for a long time you were the person I wanted to hold dear to my heart. You were my partner in crime and I thought we were meant to get through life together. I was so wrong. I was so naive. And now I feel like I’m only a shell of my former self. A lot of things really don’t matter to me. But you did. The fact that I was so replaceable really hurts. You weren’t even sad for long. You started dating other guys in only matter of days. There was someone else in the picture and you never told me. You never wanted to communicate the problems we were having and I wanted to talk about them. The way that people viewed me is that I was not a person by myself. All of friends saw me as your boyfriend. But they never saw me as me. That has always been the case but I’m not surprise. I ask myself why I should even care as it’s all in the past. But sometimes the past is just reminiscing the good times. It’s 4:37am right now and I feel like I’m the only one in the world feeling like this. I feel alone and you’re in the comfort of friends, family, and your new significant other. I wish I could just simply stop existing right now because of how much it hurts.
