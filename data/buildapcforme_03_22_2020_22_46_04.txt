 \>\*\*What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.\*\*  \* Gaming. I mainly play AAA games and other small indie type games as well. So I would like to be able to play most games at max settings relatively easily.  >\*\*What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?\*\*   \* My budget is $2500 USD but I am willing to spend up to $3000 if it is really worth it.  >\*\*When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.\*\*   \* Asap   >\*\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\)\*\*   \* Tower, OS, wireless keyboard (not going to use a traditional desk setup), wireless mouse.  >\*\*Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?\*\*   \* United States, California. No.  >\*\*If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.\*\*   \* I'm not going to use a monitor because I was planning on using a 65' 2018 4k OLED LG tv. I know that using a tv for pc gaming is dumb but my room is small so I have to pick the tv or a desk setup and I just got the tv almost a year ago. I might switch to a regular desk setup in the future but for now probably not.  >\*\*Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?\*\*   \* Yes, I would do it right away. I think the GPU...? lol  >\*\*Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)\*\*  \* Nope  >\*\*What type of network connectivity do you need? (Wired and/or WiFi) If WiFi is needed and you would like to find the fastest match for your wireless router, please list any specifics.\*\*  \*Wired  >\*\*Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?\*\*  \* The case doesn't matter, I'm going to have it hidden away anyways.   >\*\*Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?\*\*  \* Yes. Windows 10  >\*\*Extra info or particulars:\*\*
