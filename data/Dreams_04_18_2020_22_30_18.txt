I was in a kind of X-men institute for special people, it was full of boys and children who lived together - the institute was not bad, a mix between ancient and modern, but it was not huge - inside c  'were many of the old companions of Badia, especially celestial - after a while I get to know a very particular girl, very pretty, she reminds me a little of Ada when I met her, blonde with almost bob hair and blue eyes -  she was a very strange, touchy girl and she had powers that she didn't even know she had, a kind of friendship was established between us that would inevitably end with something loving, we fought, but there was that love / hate relationship, a  sometimes somewhat predictable - all of a sudden we are called back to a meeting - we were (about twenty students of the same age) on the edge of a railway, the edge then descended and reapplied, the lawn turned into wood which in turn served as  floor to a room without back wall, with roof and wall on the opposite side with front door - it looked like a small auditorium, with tiered seats, four if I'm not mistaken, it reminded me of a mini version of the Galileo classroom (if  it is called this) of the Physics University of Padua, with the benches joined together, slightly curved and made of wood - in the center, in front of the entrance door from which a nice warm light filtered in stark contrast to the diffused and colder one  coming from the sky (almost completely cloudy), there was the chair - while we were heading a boy bigger than all of us, who nobody knew, with the motorcycle suit and the shiny black helmet in his hand, short, black and curly hair and  southern features, he warned us that we had to stay close to him because they will say that we would need a surprise foreman or something like that - nobody believed him, not even me, I almost snubbed him, even if a part of me saw the s  ua real concern and sincerity - we sit down but after a while the teacher (somewhat sexy, with black skirt and tight-fitting black hair) announces what he had told us, we were disadvantaged because we had him (with us I mean myself and a few others  ) so we slings close to him, sitting on the same level but still we looked at him with distrust, we didn't trust him and we left him sitting last near the exit (it was strange because it was as if I were like the others with the body but  with my mind I saw everything, I saw his expressions of suffering because no one understood him despite saying good things and he wanted to help, it was as if it were me while playing a part never played, confirming when it was ugly) - then I see in the third person a kind  somewhat unusual lesson - there was a valley with a marshy lake, you could see a dense forest in the distance on the left, the sun was on the right - there were many coconut trees on the water  drills all of the same size that tried to bite a large Godzilla made entirely of water while it flew and seized, indifferences to the crocodiles - then every now and then the materials exchanged making sure that the crocodiles were water and Godzilla of its material - there  she was also the first teacher dressed in the same way that explained everything - then I find myself on a dirt path between two hills that prevented a good view of the rest of the landscape - at the beginning the sun was setting to the left, in front of me there was  a wooden shack, with mud underneath, and a large number of soldiers ready to march but in slightly disordered formation, it was as if everyone had received a news that made them confused - as the territory progressed it changed - I hid together  to my father under a cave (which was still in plain sight) who also looked like a kind of covered bus stop - they used to pass by  ahead but as they passed they became like garden gnomes, all red, blue and yellow, with a more human figure at the head - the hills that "protected" that path were formed by an almost perfect lawn, green and short grass - I am  I realize (seeing in the third person) that I am a mouse and I get smaller and smaller - as I get smaller I notice secret places not visible from the perspective of the first inside the cave - I see that on my right there was a priest almost  flat with geometric indents of rectangular base, one smaller than the other and each had a door that contained a door inside it and so on, from very large to very small or up to my small size from small type (cartoon style) -  I can open one of these doors (they were all very very beautiful, similar to each other, rich in details and golden twirls on a very dark smoothed wood and with steel or iron details) -  I go in and find myself at the starting point still seeing the soldiers marching, the sun was on the right, I was as if I had come out the other side - I find myself on the street where I live, in the middle of the crossroads, in front of Lisa's house  paid - I decide, or I remember, that you had to go there (it was more of a mission but with something personal) - I go down the gravel slope and go to the front door - I thought she had already heard me, I come so close  to the windows to see the inside - something was moving so she could have got up from the sofa to go to the door - I knew I had six powers and the strongest was to make myself invisible so I knew that in any case I would have been non-existent - I go  still in front of the door knocking and so she goes out but does not see me even though I was in front of her - I believed it complete in that power, it was difficult to practice it, very difficult but in any case I convinced myself so much that it was true, and therefore I  it was - then I go to the back and enter the garage - I turn on the light so as to make it clear that something was happening, the garage was somewhat messy, the door was near the priest on the right, who was Lorraine of iron shelves with many various objects  above, to the left there was shade as the yellowish light was located on the ceiling on the same line as the front door - there were many bottles of laundry detergent on the ground and other items piled up, an iron closed and leaning against the opposite wall  - in front of the door, in the opposite direction, there was a small step that led to a narrow corridor that connected the garage with the rest of the house through a door on the right, on the other hand there was more shadow and I could not see the inside at  because of the perspective and the wall of the garage room - attracted by the noise and light Lisa enters the garage but obviously she doesn't see me, meanwhile I make my way through that corridor to go into the living room - tav  oil in the center, two windows on the myth on the right, the same from which you had spied on her earlier, tv on the priest who was making a corner with the wall of the windows, large carpet on the ground and sofas under the windows - there was a beautiful light  warm from a lamp in contrast to the cold white light coming from the cloudy sky outside - suddenly we both put ourselves on the sofa and I fill myself with blankets, she stands next to me (even though she was now anyone but Lisa, if  not because of the hair color) - there was a kind of bond, of understanding between us even if I continued to apply my powers, standing there, stopped on the sofa to feel our presence - I then find myself in a garage  wide Ferrari style in Maranello - I was with Lorenzo and other people and we had to give ideas to customers on shots for racing cars - I didn't realize it was my turn, I was distracted, and so I try to remedy  to the fool saying a ser  ie of valid ideas such as one in which there was an angle so strange as to be unhealthy and exaggerated at the right point.
