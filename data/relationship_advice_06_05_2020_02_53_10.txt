Ok I know this is a relationship subreddit but this is about a guy I’m talking to and am potentially interested in. Basically we’ve been talking for about 1 month he is a white male and I’m a black female I promise this is relevant. At first everything was really cool he’s a great guy and gets my dark sense of humor and sarcasm 😎. He tells me I’m beautiful all the time but of course that’s normal so I never thought anything of it except feeling appreciated. About two weeks in was when what I guess is the first red flag occurred we were texting one night and he was telling me again how he loved talking to me and I was so beautiful and all of that sweet stuff. But right before I was typing to say thank you and compliment him back he tells me I look like a white girl who happens to have brown skin. I was shocked.... I didn’t know what to say he seemed like he thought it was a compliment and I didn’t want to be too sensitive so I brushed it off and I didn’t care about it much after. Then the second incident happened last night we were texting again and I guess he’s getting muchhhh too comfortable with me because he said that black girls were never his type and he never would’ve dated one because they aren’t attractive but that he is insanely attracted to me and said that I was “even prettier” than a lot of white girls. I told him that black girls aren’t ugly and that I don’t like him always talking to me about race when he compliments me. I guess the weight of his words sunk in because he kept saying he wasn’t racist and sort of worked himself into a frenzy in my head I really just wanted him to calm down because I don’t think he’s racist just a bit insensitive and two it’s not like I’d put him on blast or anything. I told him I was tired and that I was going to sleep and he kept talking about how he wasn’t racist again for a few minutes before we hung up. I really like this guy but I feel like I have to break up with him purely out of self respect.
