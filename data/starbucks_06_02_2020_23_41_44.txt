My boss told me I’m not allowed to wear my BLM pin but did nothing when my co worker called me a n*****, was physically assaulted twice and when another co worker talks about how much she loves Trump and tries to force her views on us. Did nothing when a co worker told me he hates Mexicans . And then proceeded to say he feels for POC because he’s scared to run at night as well (he’s a white male) . He also told me Im being immature for having feelings about being treated this way and that I needed to calm down and that he excepts more from me and that I shouldn’t let me emotions get the best of me. I’m sorry; but I wouldn’t let them if maybe people didn’t treat me like shit. Mind you I’m white passing ; I can’t imagine what a black individual would go through at my store because my boss has never hired anyways even though he’s interviewed a few. He told me this conversation was private but you best believe I’m gonna speak out about it. Not to mention the snide remarks he makes about me an another co worker being the ethnic one; making it seem like he hired me because he had to meet a quota . He’s perfectly okay with everyone else being complete assholes but when it comes to me I’m being just being dramatic. Although when my white coworker told him how she didn’t want to work for him if he was treating me this way he was very nice and calm to her. Strange how he says he supports POC but it’s very apparent whete his loyalty lies . He told me he thinks it’s best for me to transfer stores : which in turns just leads me to believe that he doesn’t want to deal with a POC anymore and that he’s afraid to hold everyone else to a higher standard and have a middle ground. Thing is; there should not be a middle ground on racism and physical assault. I’m not in fear of losing my job posting this because I would much rather be fired for standing up for myself than staying working for an underhand RACSIT. And yes HR will be emailed
