 im currently deployed right now and just need to talk, if this isn't the right subreddit for this kind of thing id like to know what one to go to. me and my ex girlfriend have broken up a few times to my own issue, i haven't went to get any help for it because im scared to, if i come home from my deployment im going to see a therapist, the girl im talking about is my whole life, i feel more for her than married couples feel for each other, we had always planned to get married but our relationships never lasted long enough to get to that point ( 3 times right now) i have deep mental issues where when i get depressed i lock myself away and hide, i dont get help, i sit alone and distance myself from others, her included, i dont know why this happens, but in the time it does, i lose everything that means something to me, this most recant time i went AWOL from her from November last year to January this year leading to our breakup. shes the only thing in my life thats ever made living worth it to me and something i dont have the ability to control deep inside keeps tearing her away from me. we still talk but things arent the same, she seems fine and im a mess, she doesn't seems to mind being single, shes told me she enjoys being single, but all i want right now is to hear her say she loves me again, it would help me out more than she understands, because right now i have nothing,i keep wondering if im gonna make it back, the military is the only job i have and its the best job i can have, it allows me to be able to support myself and it would have been able to support her as well.... shes independent so not like she needs supported anyway. before we broke up this past time she said "after i got back and a lot of therapy for both of us maybe we can work on getting back together" well ive still dedicated everything to her, i still dont talk to other girls (everyone else seems like shit compared to her, the only person i feel a genuine connection with) we talk everyday, but i feel like im pushing her away because i cant control myself, i always try and talk to her about us and the conversation always ends up with hurt feelings followed by more depression. i keep worrying that she will find someone new in the time that im gone before i can seek professional help, she has a ton of guy friends and that worries me, anytime the subject of intimacy comes up i try and jokingly ask if shes been doing anything with people and she always says "its none of your buisness" and that hurts, i understand were both single but im keeping myself just for her and i dont feel like shes doing the same even though we talked about getting help together to better our future, if she got with someone else with the plans of working on us and while i was away.... i dont know what id do... thats heartbreak i dont think i will ever be ready for, i have nothing in life, and if i lost that little bit of hope for us im not sure what would come after that, i just know it wouldnt be good......
