So I was working by myself 3-11 tonight. Fully booked. 60+ check ins by myself. I was already having a busy night. It took me an hour to eat a salad because people kept walking in to check in. Not all of the reg cards were printed out and I didn’t even have time to do my beginning of shift bucket check. All I had time for was apologizing to people because they booked the wrong room online and they didn’t get the jacuzzi room blah blah blah.... they didn’t have enough towels, they needed more blankets, the remote to the tv wasn’t working, the light is out by the mirror. At about 8:00pm im finally getting around to checking in my CLC guests on the CLC website and here comes Mr Cocky with a $5 bill in his hand. I looked up from my computer and politely asked him what I could do for him in my best faked customer service voice. He said back to me “ what can I do for you to make your night better? “. I told him that that my night was going fine and that I didn’t need anything to make it better. He proceeded to keep asking me the same question 5,000 times while getting the same answer every single time. The he changed it up and asked me what I was going to do when I got off work. I told him I was going home. He asked me what do you have at home and I said my sister. He said well you could just spend the night with me for Valentine’s Day and you won’t have to drive home. ( I live in another town 35 minutes away from the hotel I work at ) I told him that I was ok and I didn’t need to do that. He said oh come on I won’t tell anyone and nobody will know. I looked at him with the most serious smile less face I have and said trust me when I say they will know. ( our owners just installed 12 more cameras around the hotel in addition to what we already have thus tightening our nooses even more snugly ) He said how are they going to know anyways then asked me again. I told him no I can’t do that I’m sorry. Then he leaned forward and said well you know what room I’m in you can just make a key and come down when you clock out so I can make your face smile. I said when I clock out I’m driving home so I can go to sleep I’m very tired. He eventually got tired of me shooting him down and handed me the $5 bill in his hand and asked for change. I opened my drawer and gave him five $1 bills and told him to have a good night. He walked away & I was never happier to see a guest walk away from my desk tonight ever. It happens way toooo often and I don’t know what they think I am going to say like “ sure sir I’ll be down to your room as soon as I clock out so I can get fired for being unprofessional and sleeping with a guest. Because I don’t really need this job or my paycheck or anything, I’m just working to kill the extra time I have in life because I’m secretly rich ya know, plus that would be an excellent job reference for the future. So thank you so much sir I’ll be right there.” Smdh 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
