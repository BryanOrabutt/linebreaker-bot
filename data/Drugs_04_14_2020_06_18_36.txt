So, I need some tips/advice on smoking weed. When I was 14-17, I smoked weed HEAVILY. Like real heavy, I smoked all day everyday. I used to sell so I had it like that, never paid for what I smoked. Blunts back to back pretty much all day even at work. My high was my sober. I got caught up in some shit when I was 17 and I stopped smoking for a while. I smoked a year later at a concert and had the worst time of my life. My anxiety and paranoia was off the charts. I figured it was because of all the cops and large crowd though. I’ve smoked a few times since then, by myself, with friends, different scenarios and the same thing happens. I just instantly start having panick attacks, start shaking, pale face, and sometimes even start throwing up. Last time I smoked I puked for hours, couldn’t move or talk and almost had to go to the ER. (It was a dab, I hadn’t smoked in months so idk why I even tried) But anyway, I just miss being able to get high and enjoy it. I thought part of it is because I’ve learned to control my real anxiety and emotions while sober, so now when I’m high it changes the way I think & feel and sends me into a “this isn’t right” type mood and I start freaking out. Me and my ex just broke up (we were together 3 years) and I have completely lost myself during that relationship also and want to start smoking again but I’m scared I’m going to have these panick attacks and stuff. I think another part of it, is that I have no tolerance. I’ll take 1 hit, baby hit and be fucked up for hours and be in full panic mode. I think if I can make time to build my tolerance I would be good but I’m just wondering if anyone else has this issue & if you do or had, how did you overcome it or what are some tips to help me? I suffer from anxiety really bad to begin with and weed actually used to HELP ALOT with that. Used to help me sleep and get through my day feeling good. Now it’s just a nightmare. Please help lol
