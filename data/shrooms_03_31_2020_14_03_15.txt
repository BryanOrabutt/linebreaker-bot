I have wanted to try shrooms for so long now but I could just never get hold of them, so I decided I would just grow my own. Anyway recently having my very first harvest I was over the moon excited but I had a creeping anxiety build over me at the same time, It‚Äôs that fear that was pushed on us as kids that all drugs are bad and psychedelics will make you go crazy and give you psychosis and all that nonsense, the problem with me is that I know that‚Äôs not true, but I suffer from ocd, borderline personality disorder and my dr thinks possibly bipolar also, and that makes it really hard for me to convince myself that Everything‚Äôs going to be fine, I still have that constant fear that something terrible will happen to me just from taking mushrooms, I smoke weed most days currently and recently started microdosing shrooms taking .2 one day on two days off then I went up to .4 on the same schedule. I was feeling better definitely knew something was happening but it made me think of this is what just microdosing can do for me then imagine a proper dose, it‚Äôs my goal to have a full trip I think I will get a huge amount of benefit and knowledge from a trip but I‚Äôm still way too scared but slowly I‚Äôm working up the courage and I‚Äôll beat all my illnesses at once when I get there, anyway today I took 1g lemon tek about 12pm I drank it slowly so I didn‚Äôt get myself into something I wasn‚Äôt ready for but when I finally finished the cup I could feel my feet had this tingly feeling and my body had a kinda edible weed high feeling and it just felt really nice all over, nothing major happened I kinda just continued about my day as usual playing with the kids and cleaning and setting up things for the kids to do etc which actually felt a lot more fun for me and I even had a popcorn party with some music with them late afternoon haha, but everything just felt beautiful and very peaceful. I went out to smoke an joint and was just paying attention to how beautiful nature is and how happy we should be on this land. Then I went in and had a shower and had a moment where it felt like something wash over me and It‚Äôs kinda hard to explain but my whole headspace and everything shifted into a really calm and positive place and I got this strong kinda msg that was telling me I need to become one with myself and to work with myself more and not fight the negative side of things and just not even give them anytime at all and they will fade away, just focus on yourself and find your inner piece, and I felt amazed and refreshed when I came out of that shower and even now I still feel like almost a different person, I‚Äôm becoming the person I want to be, I just can‚Äôt wait until I can do a larger dose and have a real life changing experience. Mush love to you all and stay safe in these crazy times ‚ù§Ô∏èüçÑ
