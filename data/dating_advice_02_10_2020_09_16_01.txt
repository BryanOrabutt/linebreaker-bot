Lately it seems that my relationship of 6 years is taking yet ANOTHER turn for the worst. We are 21 and 22 and have been together since we were 15 and 16 years old. We have broken up and gotten back together a few times over the years. During those periods where we were single we were with other people. One boundary we have in our relationship is that we don’t keep our ex’s on our social media out of respect for one another. Well I stumbled upon one of his ex’s on Instagram the other day and did some stalking. On her profile I noticed that he liked tons of her recent photos. I brought it up to him and he claimed he didn’t even follow her. When he brought up his profile to show me, her name up came up under “muted accounts” which means he doesn’t see what she posts. So to me, that tells me he was looking her up to see her photos so if he was sitting next to me, her posts wouldn’t show up while scrolling. I don’t care if he likes girls photos I really don’t. Having friends that are girls are fine! But when it’s someone that you once had feelings for, it hits different. It makes me scared he’s going to go back to her. Or just having a back up in case we break up again. When I asked him to just block her and keep her there he said he would. I found that he did block her on one social media platform .. but about a week later put her back on Facebook instead of Instagram , thinking I’m too dumb to notice. He said I’m being crazy and controlling. I think he’s being sneaky! We’ve been in a few other situations where I’ve found him actually talking to other girls and I let those things go but when I see things like this, it stirs those feelings back up I can’t help it. I know that if the tables were turned he wouldn’t take this so lightly either. Is it time to just let go? I feel like when u have these trust issues it’s just time to move on for good.
