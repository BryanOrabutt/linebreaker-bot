I have been for 8 years my wife's submissive cuckold in a female led marriage. I am completely hetero just submissive. Thru the years there have been plenty of humiliating times because of this. She likes dominant men, just not me trying to dominate, says I just don't have it. 2 years ago she gave herself to Master Nate as his slave. Things started and he was mostly ambivalent towards me when he would come over to see her. As he got used to it he also started ordering me around, making me don a dress when he is around and stuff like that, says only room for 1 man in the house when he is around. He has required me to do things like ask him to please my wife, put him in her, clean them both after sex, stuff like that. About 3 months back after I served them dinner they sat on the couch watching TV as I washed the dishes and cleaned up, my wife naked him not. He told me to come over where they were. I come over, curtsy and ask yes Sir. He tells me to get on my knees. I do as he says. He then tells me to unzip him and take it out and I do. Then he says kiss the tip and having done it before I do. He tells me to blow him. I hesitate and shake my head. He slapped my face and said now bitch. I do so as he and my wife were laughing and joking about my current dilemma. As some point she tells me if I don't want to taste his cum to take him deep as possible when he starts twitching, take my word it works. As I kept doing it I felt it doing something followed by him saying not to spill a drop so I took my wife's advice and took it back as far as I could. Found she was right I tasted nothing. Was then directed to keep him in my mouth till he got soft, I did as he said. He then tells me I can go finish the dishes now. It took me days to unpack my feelings after that. I have no homosexual tendencies yet the humiliation of the whole situation really turned me on. Thank god I haven't had to do it since. Just getting it off my chest.
