So, This story is still on going but i was longing to post the start of the story, So I'm playing a beast master ranger and we're playing a super home-brew campaign and we are in a Nordic setting with Odin, Thor, Loki, etc. and there are 3 clans currently at war with each other, These clans are of Thor, Loki, and Helga, (Thor has been killed and we don't know who killed him yet) so his clan has no leader and wont listen to Odin) We were being held captive at one of the forts of Thor's clan who wasn't trusting of anyone and a raiding party of Loki came and we ended up getting out and catching on a ship from a merchant friend who was also being kept there, On the ship ride we were asked to go down to this underwater cave, we were given potions of water breathing and went down there and as we were going down, something was calling out to me, low and behold this cute little sea cucumber came up and started calling me "Master" and how it "heard my call for help so it came to protect me" outside of the game i wasn't really excited for this because all the meme stuff is normally pushed to me, but inside my character didn't understand why it was here but it latched on to me and followed and so we went into this cave and met underwater lizard men and we couldn't understand them, so our paladin tried talking to them, got knocked out and taken and we got to the next room and had to fight more lizard men, we ended up getting to this big lizard that basically destroyed us and brought us to his queen that was intending on invading the land above and "reclaiming was originally theirs, My cucumber who i knew nothing about, everyone left the room but me bc she took my companion away because at the time i didnt want it, so she took it away but in the end i wanted him back and she intended on killing us, and these "sea cucumbers" have prenatural senses so it senses extreme danger and knew she was gonna kill us, so what does it do? it blows itself up killing everything in the room, including me, After that I woke up in talking to my dead father, who we talked about things and now my goal is to reunite with my clan with my newfound companion, we weren't bonded yet but i tried to revive him anyways and it was a 31 percent chance but i ended up pulling it off and this thing is super home brew and a really cool creature, who if eaten can use its powers to permanently become the creature that eats it, Ill do further updates about the Tale of "Hern the Masked Hunter and Kai the Seacucumber Companion"
