So, I recently moved halfway across the country and I was emotionally abused by my dad for 13 years and I have no control over my emotions and thoughts. but I have been working and getting better, I have come a long way and now am trusting people again. Yesterday was Valentine’s Day and I dropped all of my plans to call the girl i have a crush on that lives were I used to. I was so happy and was looking forward to watching a movie with her. But she blew up on me and was mad at me for talking about my situation and that i still have a hard time trusting but that I trust her and she just got worse and eventually said she was going to go. I said ok. Even though when I get really bad I overthink, my mind goes blank and I think irrationally and it’s bad but rarely happens anymore. But I prefer to have someone with me or on the phone when it gets that bad so I feel safe and so I don’t do anything I would regret. She told me later that she was sorry and she knows she doesn’t really help with my healing and I forgave her. But last night I was making a motionless in white fan account because I couldn’t sleep so I added my main account so I could add my friends to the account while I was adding my friends I saw that she posted something on her story I didn’t really think anything of it and thought I would go threw my story’s on my main account when I was done I went and looked threw all the story’s but her story was gone so i was confused and went back to my fan account and saw that it was still there. So she blocked her story from me and she has these times where she acts really weird. And just ripped up the trust I gave her. I honestly just want to tell her to leave me alone. She is my only friend and I feel hurt, untrusted and like she has been just being nice to me. I don’t know what I should do or if I’m overthinking it.
