i need advice because i don’t know many people who have had issues in this department so idk what to do. my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost 2 1/2 years and his mom has been treating me oddly. she gives me advice and tries treating me like her own daughter. definitely not in a good way more in a stepping over boundaries way. whenever i’m hanging out at my boyfriends house she comes in his room and asks to have “girl talk” so obviously i have to but she’s the kind of person that never stops talking so i was in for 3 hours of listening. every time we have one of these “girl talks” it’s to criticize me on my weight, behavior, appearance, or the way i handle my boyfriend. she has insulted me before but in a nice way so if i tell my boyfriend she would say she wasn’t. my boyfriend is a serious mamas boy and it’s caused many many issues in our relationship. he is 21 and wont let anyone cut his hair but his mom. last time we had a “girl talk” she cut my hair because she said it looked bad (she’s a hairstylist) and i was too scared to tell her no because she’s honestly a scary person and gets upset easily. then she compared me to my boyfriends pregnant aunt and told me I needed to lose weight because it was embarrassing that someone my age (19) would look like that. lately I’ve been noticing that whenever i don’t come over his house she’s super nice to him and they don’t have issues but when i come over she all of a sudden has 99 problems with him and is constantly getting upset at him and barging in his room every 10 seconds to yell at him. i don’t know what to do because when I talk to him about it even though he acknowledges his mom does those things to me he refuses to do anything about it because he doesn’t want to upset her. there is much more to the story but i wanted to sum it up the best i can lol. i don’t know what to do :((( she’s killing our relationship
