I'm in a quandry.  Can someone with brain power help me by *weighing in* on what I should do?  I typically do quite well Airbnbing a bed/bath in my home and a detached private studio in Southern California.  In February, I had $6500 in bookings.  March was $4300.  April $1435.  With COVID-19 and mounting cancellations mid March through April, I scrambled and got a nurse and police couple in my studio unit quickly for 25 nights using Furnished Finder site.  The $1125.00 booking was through Airbnb at a very deep discount.  I did not want to have to deal with credit checking and lease creation and had hours to make this happen...  This stay is punctuated by a 5-day vacation rental which may end up cancelling at the end of April ($580), I have reached out twice, but they refuse to cancel yet although the travel ban will still be in effect, so I don't know how they would get here.   Then another 20 days with the same nurse and cop couple through May 15 ($911).  A 3-DAY studio vacation rental May 15-18 ($413) -- that's all that is left for May.  I have one studio vacation rental June 30 - July 6.  ($800) That is all I have for June. I have one July booking ($300) and two September bookings (totalling $1500). I have an opportunity to get a nurse in on a longer term lease from  6/6/20Â - 9/5/20 at $1500 a month and then a physician starting end of August at $1500 a month for a year.  Should I take the vantage point that things might be bad for a while and no one will either be travelling or can afford to travel and go with the long term bookings -- yielding 1/3rd of my typical vacation rental income?  Or stick to my vacation rental guns -- potentially sit vacant through June, July and August, and pray to God my September rentals don't cancel and wait it out.  No one has a crystal ball, I know, but this decision is important and I'm making it alone. I'm 2 years from retirement and a freelancer with an $800 month in healthcare premiums.  If I do go longer term and in 2022 get back into the vacation rental market, I lose all my glowing studio reviews.  But I could still do the in-house "Plus" rental if things turn around.  What do you think oh great Karnak's out there?  Any opinions?  Should I stay or should I go now?
