About three weeks ago I fucked up. Being in quarantine had forced me to live 24/7 in my toxic environment. It's hard because I can manage a lot more often when I can at least go out when I'm feeling bad. Now I just go back to my old habits of sleeping and isolating. I also after a really bad fight did what I did three weeks ago. I don't know how long it will be till I do it again honestly. I'm too terrified to talk to my therapists about it though cause I don't want to end up in the hospital. I have nowhere to go and stay during this time outside of maybe a week which even then isn't too safe. I really am just so fucked up since before hand I was really making progress and this whole thing hit. Top it off my phone is broken so now even if it weren't just for my isolation I can't call my friends. All I have really is my three online friends. One of them is also isolating which had made me paranoid that I've done something wrong even though they're doing the exact same thing as me. I don't know how I am gonna survive if I have to keep this up all summer. The one thing that tends to bring my mood up regardless of my mental state are conventions and those are all being canceled. One the worst parts about my home is that because all the of the bad parts are verbal and mental no one sees it as wrong. No one sees it as wrong when my yells at me for a small joke. No one sees it as wrong as my dad screaming at me when I'm just a tad ticked off like any other person. No one sees half the shit my parents do as wrong simply because they're not hitting me. Top it off I am constantly misgendered and I just feel so fucking dysphoric. I got a little taste of what it was like to be properly addressed and seen before quarantine and now I am stuck here having my parents scream at me saying that they/them pronouns for a singular person is an attack on the English language. I don't know what to do or if I'll be safe from cutting for much longer.
