Been married for around 5 years now and have 3 children all under the age of 7. Me and my wife knew each other in high school but didn't start to date until years after. We both enjoyed our sex life with each a lot. Then she got pregnant and then i popped the question and we got married. Never felt like we had a deep connection only by a sexual way you can say. A couple of years later she's pregnant again and a year later i find out she cheated on me with an ex, which led to figuring out that the kid was his. That was devastating but i played it cool and me being such a nice positive person allow him to visit the kid here and there. that went on a month or so and my wife tells me she's pregnant again. Can you guess who the father is again? I should of left then but i couldn't allow myself to ruin these kids children hood because of their mom's choices. So i stepped up went to court and me and my wife won full custody of the 2 kids (i should of gotten the first one tested to). So now years later i wake up everyday thinking my life is normal raising 2 kids that look more and more like her ex everyday. What has gotten me really down after all these years is that everyday just feels the same. I have to maintain the house hold while my wife works and the goes to night school monday through thursday. So after i get off a 10 hour shift im the one who has to watch all 3 kids and clean the house. She'll come home pissed already from school then get more pissed because the house is not clean to her standards. I try my best but some days are more tiring at work then others and im usually asleep when she gets home which makes her even more mad. I try to talk to her about it but she always says "its a sacrifice we have to make" so she can get her education. which will be another 8 years maybe? yeah fuck that. idk i just can't be in this situation any longer. I need a change
