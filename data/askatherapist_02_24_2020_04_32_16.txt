I can enjoy things. I like playing the game, hanging w friends, because it’s fun. Of course it’s fun. But I don’t honestly care about them. I don’t want to lose them or want them to die or something like that but if they left or died I would be more upset about having to make new friends that were funny and everything, I would have lost a whole schools life in grooming and molding them to be like me. Have my humor, be callous.. they act how I want them to act because of how I made them. And if I lost them I wouldn’t have the chance to do it again. We’re young adults now and so molding someone is going to be extremely more of a pain in be neck. I’m indifferent to them but enjoy them and want them to be around..I’m indifferent to my family. Don’t get me wrong they’re good people and I grew up being loved. But I never felt the same way about them. They’re just a group of people I was born into and idk but I don’t feel that unconditional love towards them. My job is nice I make good money but I don’t care about it nor am I motivated by money. I’m not motivated to go really I just do it because that’s what we’re supposed to do..I’m just moving. Not that life is meaningless I just don’t think it’s meaningful. I don’t like talking about it with people in fear of being alienated. I do have emotions..I know so because sometimes I cry and I’m sad. Sometimes I get angry. Sometimes I’m enjoying myself. But there’s always that indifference to everything still there. I almost got hit by a car on a highway while riding my bike.. I remember looking at it..had to be going at least 40 and I remember saying in my head “what do you want to do?” And I let it get closer and then at the last second the car swerved out of the way, jumped the divider and braked. I was alive. While I’m typing this I realize how it sounds. Never looked at the words like that or even thought back to it. I don’t want to die. But when put in that scenario it feels like I chose to die. I wasn’t scared or anything and it felt cold and warm at the same time. It felt like nothing And I remember seeing my friends faces. I turned around to look at them and they were horrified. And to calm them down I smiled. I have suicidal thoughts but I doubt I’ll ever act on them. It’s just how everyone thinks about it but really would never do it. I usually think about everything I do. My facial expression, my micro expressions. I’m prone to some slip ups here and there but I’m aware of myself 90% of the time. I try using it to my advantage and it had its perks ya know.. making people feel deeper bonds, or building trust.. making people feel that you are authentic and real. But it feels like every thing I do or say is a lie. And honestly it is (isn’t that a paradox?) everything I said to them about my past or what I’m doing is a lie..it’s easier to lie than to tell the truth. Not lying for any gain but just to keep their mind at ease that I’m ok. I hate when people worry😭gets in the way of everything. I’m talking to you as if you were a therapist and I was in a chair😂. I’m trying to be professional sounding while not overbearing. And I know not everybody wants to sit there and read all this so I’ll stop now😂
