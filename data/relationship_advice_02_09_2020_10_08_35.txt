So my girlfriend  (20F) and I (18M) of almost 2 years broke up recently and I’m unsure of what to do exactly because the reason we broke up has to do with a lot of things. I essentially made the mistakes of getting upset over things that didn’t matter right after a period of not being able to talk to her for a while and so I wasn’t being there for her because of it, she had no internet for a little while and it’s long distance so she basically came back and had to deal with me being stupid when her current living situation is already stressing her out so she started feeling really sad/depressed to the point where she just felt like she couldn’t give love to me or anyone and so she broke things off with me cuz she thought it’d help me not be so sad that she wasn’t giving back any affection even though I didn’t realize it was me who pushed her to that for the most part so for now she says she doesn’t feel like she can be in a relationship with anybody right now. But afterwards she admitted that she had a crush on this other guy assumedly because he’s giving her all the things she wanted from me when she came back but said she’s not going to pursue anything cuz like she said she doesn’t feel capable of a relationship right now. I know she still loves me and has a place in her heart for me because she told me and she knows that I’ve realized my mistakes now and can give her what she needs. I even made a video of myself saying how sorry I was and how I still love her and just want the chance to prove to her I can make her happy and give her the future we both talked about when she’s ready. But I guess what I’m asking is, when should I send her the video? Because she’s been spending a lot of time with this guy everyday and even though I doubt she would considering how long we’ve together and how good things were up until recently I’m scared she’s gonna move on without a second thought and not give me a chance. But like I said I don’t think she would just move on without thinking twice about coming back to me considering how easily fixable the mistakes I made were. But like I said I don’t know how long I should wait to send her the video and if meanwhile I should try and keep hanging out with her or not because this all happened yesterday officially but sorta has been going on for another week or two.
