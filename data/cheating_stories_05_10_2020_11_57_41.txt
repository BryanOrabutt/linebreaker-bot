I was with my ex for about two years and tbh it was lokey toxic from the start. I had trust issues with her and she would lie a lot but being a teenager instead of fixing things i just brush it off hoping she would change. We were at her house one day and she went to take a shower and she left her phone on the table. I grabbed it and went on snap to type some guys name I know she would flirt with and I told her to block him and she told me she did, but typing his name I see him pop up so I look through the  messages and I find out she been seeing him and senting him nudes and all that cheating crap. Like I said we had a lot of issues so at this point I didint even care i chucked and I just knew we were done for sure. But me being the asshole I am I wasint just gonna break up with her and leave it at that I wanted to get back at her. So a few days later I told her let's go downtown(Chicago) and go to a park called Maggie daily park and go out to eat, she said sure and we took the blue line to the park. Later she said she was hungry so went to go eat pizza at some restaurant by the park. To get to the point we finished eating and we ordered a pretty good amount of food the waiter comes and I asked for the check and I told my girlfriend I was gonna pay for the food not to worry about it cuz she only $10. Before the waiter could come back I told her I was going to pee and I'll be quick. The restaurant has two sides to it and we were on the other side where it was just all tables the other side was where the batroom and the the entrance is. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this and I did exactly that. I walked out and texted her how I seen the messages between her and the guy that I'm tired of being with her and to go fuck herself. Best day of my life free food and got back at her for cheating on me
