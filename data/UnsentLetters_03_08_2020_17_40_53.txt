It’s been months since we last saw each other. I can’t help but feel sad knowing that you’re moving on from me. I remember you telling me that you would never go for the girl you’re with now because she was “ugly, not your type, and is your bestfriend’s ex-girlfriend”, but I forgive you. I remember us arguing because you never mentioned me to any of your friends nor even post a story of me on your Instagram, yet you post everything you and your new gf do on ig and introduced her to everyone. But I forgive you. You got into a new relationship not even a month after us breaking up. But I forgive you. You told me you’re going to stay single for a long while because you’re going to work on yourself and your school, but you didn’t and I forgive you. Every excuse you made for not doing what I asked you to do for me, but you’re doing it for her, I have already forgiven. I forgive you for causing me this INTENSE heartache. I forgive you for not trying to make our relationship work. I forgive you for not loving me enough. I forgive you for not understanding me. I forgive you for leaving me at my worst. I forgive you for falling out of love. I forgive you meaning your last couple “I love yous”. I forgive you for not being the one for me. I forgive you for leaving us in the past. No I’m not forgiving you because you deserve it, I’m forgiving you for my peace and for my sanity. So I can finally go to bed early. So I can finally start focusing on myself. So I can go to the beach without thinking of you. So I can finally listen to all my old favorite songs because I told you all those songs reminded me of you. So that in the future if I see you with her, I could be genuinely happy for you. I’m forgiving you so I can forgive myself for staying in a place that didn’t want me. I’m forgiving you so that I can forgive myself for trying to piece two pieces that didn’t belong together. I have forgiven you and I have forgiven myself.
