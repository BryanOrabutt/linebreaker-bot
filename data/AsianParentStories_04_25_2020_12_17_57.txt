my dad gave me a ring on my 15 birthday. I was never good with rings because I tend to take it out of my hand and forget where i put it but never outside my house tho. Because this is a birthday gift from my father i was more careful. One day I was in my backyard, I took out the ring and put it on the table but I feared that I might forget about it so I put it in my pocket. 2 days later they asked me where my ring is. I panicked, it was inside the left pocket of the pant i wore 2 day ago but for some reason i completely forgot about that and only remember that put it on the table, I even remember the exact place I put it. Of course they were pissed, got called ungrateful a lot and for some reason my studies were involved. after a lot of yelling I finally remembered where it is. I tried to explain to them but my mother cut me off and said “I don’t want to here any more exscuses from you” the way she said it made me think she got no more hope for me and my words is worthless which I completely understand so i went inside my room and try to hold back my tears. My father then enter the room and ask if I wanna sell the ring because he could just sell it back, i said yes and explained the reason i forgot about it after that he told me to go and wash my face. That was all i need, just somebody who would listen to me. Then i got a text from my mother. It was a picture of the 3 of us on a vacation a month ago under the picture said “we are getting older. When will you grow up (we can only look forward for you to take care of us in the future)” I WAS 15, THIS IS TOO MUCH EXPECTATION and why the hell did she think it’s much better texting than say it directly to me, the guilt just keep flowing back. It took a couple of minutes to come out because i have to calm myself down.
