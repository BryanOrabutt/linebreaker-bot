As the title says, my (32F) SO (32M) thinks that alone time is earned. Admittedly we have had a rough year. My LO started actual school this year and with neuro diverse brain and suspected autism  spectrum it’s been a rough road. I’m a single parent, we aren’t married. I think that’s important to note that we are not in fact legally married although that’s been the goal since we started dating 3 years ago. He feels overall that he’s been neglected emotionally and I feel like it’s not even in his rights to demand more time with me when my plate is already full.  I asked for him to go on a guys trip or to go camping with this COVID stuff going on, my LO finally going to my NEX for summer break I desperately want and need some alone time. He took it as breaking up and told me that we need to work on our relationship first then maybe I can “earn” alone time....... the record did in fact scratch in my head because he hasn’t even proposed yet but wants all these guarantees of what a husband would get when he has made it perfectly clear he still has doubts and therefore has not officially proposed. Somehow in his brain it equates to me being the one responsible seeing as I have been too busy trying to take care of LO and her education and pay all the bills and do all the housework etc. He lost his job because of COVID pandemic and I asked multiple times for help with homeschool so that I could focus on other things in order to create relationship time..... but he didn’t do it, and so with me doing everything that it takes to keep a house running and everyone alive? I’ve been tired and really really really looking forward to maybe 3 days where I could lounge and not worry about someone else’s dishes, clothes, well being maybe? I am burnt out. To him this means hover and hover and hover some more and ask for cuddles. I don’t think it’s wrong of me or even out of sorts to ask my bf to go keep himself busy for a couple of days..... but then again maybe I am the A-hole?
