So over quarantine my relationship with my parents has gotten a lot worse. Firstly, they've abandoned their duties to teach my six year old sister and instead make me teach her (She and I get our own work on google classroom). I have my own work to do as a sophomore in high school and have to stay up late just to get my work done. Teaching my sister takes at least three hours out of my day and leaves me tired af. It's so difficult to make her cooperate. Today was a really bad day. After helping my sister, my mom comes to check if I taught her properly. She then questions how my sister finished all her work quicker then usual. I simply said that there was less work and she cooperated today. My mom refuses to believe any of that. She says that I helped her finish my giving her the answers when that isn't true. I showed her proof that I didn't do that, but she still said I was tricking her. My sister herself even said that wasn't true when I asked her. My mom was still resilient to believe me. After this, she told me to make my sister redo all the work. This was a pain in the ass for both me and my sister. I said if she really cared about my sister's education that much then she should do it. After this my mom lost it. She grabbed me by my hair and threw me on the ground. She then stomped on my thighs will I was on the ground and hit me a couple of times. After, everything cooled down and I went upstairs. She then started to cry loudly in front of my sister purposely and said that it was my fault. However, I'm 99% sure that she was just doing this to make me feel bad and that everything that just happened was my fault. She was talking and crying obnoxiously loud just to make me feel like I was at fault. At this point I don't know what to do. Is this considered child abuse cause I would love to leave this hell hole of a house or am I just over reacting/at fault? Sorry for the long post, I just don't know what to do.
