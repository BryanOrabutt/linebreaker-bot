I'm a guy and when I was in 7th grade, I had a much bigger friend sexually assault me on two different occasions. The second time my parents walked in on it and when I told them what was happening they didn't believe me. They threw the bible at me and took me to church, even though I kept trying to tell them I didn't want what was happening to me. I had to deal with my parents being mad at me and the fact that I had got taken advantage of. In some ways, I am happy my parents walked in because it probably would have kept happening, but because they did I could never be around the kid again. Not even for my own safety, but because they didn't want their kid to be gay. But being gay or bi is what I struggle with now and have for the last 4 years. I find no attraction to men at all, but consistently want to have sex with men. And the few times I've done it, I've hated it. And before anybody says that maybe I didn't find the right person... I've done hookups to going on dates and getting to know a guy first. I have never once enjoyed gay sex. I've had sex with women and the trauma doesn't affect that other than maybe insecurities but nothing to where I can't perform. It's getting frustrating now because I have this constant need to want to do something with a guy. I'll look on Grindr all day waiting for somebody to respond and nine times out of ten when they do, I end up not going through with it (I'm an asshole I know). I just wish I would stop feeling the need to have gay sex when I don't like it. I wish I did enjoy it but I don't and never have been able to make myself. I have a therapist and I told her that I was assaulted but I haven't been able to tell her about the need to have sex with men. Not because I'm embarrassed but more because I have other issues that I came to her for and don't want to throw this into the mix now. I don't know what to do.
