Hi I'm 20 years old and my dad has been clean for 13 years so I grew up in the NA meeting rooms. He was really bad into heroin for the final three or four years before he got clean. In that time he overdosed 13 times, 3 of those times I found him when I was a child. My dad has done amazing things since he's gotten clean; he speaks at rehabs, schools, and prisons. He sponsors other addicts. He got remarried and lives in a beautiful house with his wife and three other children. I still have nightmares about him using where I wake up in cold sweats and tears, and I still panic every time I see an ambulance, but aside from that, I very rarely worry about him relapsing because 13 years is such a long time and that past just seems so out of reach. But today I went over to his house to take my siblings sled riding, and after getting dressed and going back upstairs from the basement, all of my nightmares came to life. I found him standing at the counter holding a 10 dollar bill, no big deal. Then I noticed that there was a credit card sitting beside him on the counter and I asked what he was doing, to which he casually replied "nothing." I picked up the dish towel that was sitting next to him on the counter only to find a pile of white powder. My whole world just crumbled around me, I immediately started crying and asked him what the f\*ck he was doing. He said it was "only pain pills." I made him rinse the powder down the sink, and yelled some more obscenities before going back downstairs. I didn't say anything else about it after the fact but I just have no idea what to do. Am I making mountains out of molehills? Is this as big of a deal as I feel like it is, or am I overreacting? Do I call his sponsor?  Do I tell my stepmom (who is also in recovery with 14 years clean)? Do I start drug testing him? I just have so many things running through my mind right now, so any type of advice or anything at all really would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
