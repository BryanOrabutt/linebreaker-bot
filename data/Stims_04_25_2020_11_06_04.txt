I was falsely diagnosed with ADD at 9 years old by my primary doctor, and they prescribed me 5mg of adderall. I always noticed that school was fun in the mornings, but fucking god awful in the afternoons due to the come down, but never questioned why. At age 13 I met someone who was in college, and they enlightened me on what adderall was and how much fun it can be if I took more than prescribed. I asked my doctor to bump my dose to 20mg, and she happily obliged. Seeing how easy it was, I gradually increased my prescription to 60mg a day. Iâ€™m now a senior in highschool and it takes 180mg to get me through the day. Four months ago, during finals season, I went on a 3 day binge with no sleep (brought an F to B+ ayo) but it threw me into a state of panic I had never felt before and I made my parents take me to the ER because I was convinced I was having a heart attack. I got there, I was told I was just having a panic attack and the doctor informed parents that 60mg was way too much for me to be taking. A week later, I went to my doctor and she prescribed me 20mg of concerta. I had to allow this all to happen in fear of raising suspicion if I protested. Concerta did absolutely nothing for me, so the plan was to let the month pass by, tell her it made me sleepy and that I did better on adderall. But no, she recommenced me to a psychiatrist who took me off of stimulants completely to try out Zoloft first, did the month of Zoloft, told her I needed something for the ADD and that I did good on adderall and maybe the Zoloft would help with the anxiety, BUT SHE PUTS ME ON 10MG OF RITALIN. I have to take 80mg just to get a 15 minute high with the absolute worse come down. I did 600mg in two days. I just really want my adderall back. What should I tell her, how do I not come off as a fiend. Has anyone with ADD/ADHD experienced any real negative side effects of Ritalin, if so let me steal your story.
