 Hello I will be completely honest here. I am not good at making a convo. I have been withdrawn for many years from all friends. This is because when I was 19, I meet the "love" of my life. We have 3 kids together now. But have fallen out of love this past 2 years. I am moving out in a few days because there is no intimacy, no passion, no touching, nothing. She insists on sleeping on the couch while i have our room all to myself. She has always been over jealous so she has pushed all my friends out of my life. If i smile or say anything to another female with her present it is drama, I am to old for drama (yah i know 25 right lol) the worst part is the drama and bs is directed to me not anyone else. She yells at me and is completely rude and when I call her out on it she claims she is not and tells me to shut up pretty regularly. go figure right but I was bully all my life growing up so I do not shut up until I'm ready. sorry if it sounds like I am venting. I am a little while at the same time looking for someone that wants to talk over night while i am at work and very bored. At the same time I want you to know i have basically been verbally and mentally abused for some time now. (damaged goods? lol) I live in the USA and play magic heroes rush and have discord and whatsapp. I also have an Xbox 1 S with titan fall and mine craft but when I move I already know she will put up a fight for it because she bought it for me as a gift but apparently it is only mine if I am with her (controlling) I read a lot when I cant do anything in my game or my college homework is done. I do not care if you are older or younger but please do not message me if you are a minor for real I do not need any legal troubles here. Thank you and have a blessed day everyone.
