So I've been trying to lose weight for a long while and I always stop around like 2 weeks I just stop eating food It makes me super angry all the time when I feel super hungry. My plan usually just consists of exercise and just counting my macros and calories. I've lost a lot of motivation for exercise and I can never stop myself from getting a glass of pop or eating that super bad pizza. I've stopped trying for a few months it has helped feel better and I've gained some of the motivation back but I feel more unhealthy than ever. I almost do no exercise other than walking around basically. I've been trying for a few years but it always end up with me quitting because I can't stop myself from eating that burger or soda. I just don't have the will power to do it. I've been on a diet for the last 2 weeks I've been doing ok I've had eaten lots of bad stuff but I've kept it under what I need to lose weight other than the other day when I just said screw it and went nuts eating like 4 pizza slices and like 2 large glasses of pop I ate till I couldn't eat anymore. But because of that I didn't eat any but some jerky and a chicken sandwich yesterday. I'm just having so much trouble keeping up because I want to give up so badly but I mean I kind of already failed it but I'm not giving up. Also I have no idea what I'm doing in the gym that's the main reason I stopped exercising I just don't even know if all this work is even helping. TLDR - I have no self control when it comes to eating and I'm about to break again on my diet how to I stay on it? Also I've many times from many places and no one will help me come up with a simple beginner exercise plan that would actually help me lose fat. (I have no idea what I'm doing at the gym and it makes me not want to exercise at all because I don't know if what I'm doing is helping or all the work is for nothing.
