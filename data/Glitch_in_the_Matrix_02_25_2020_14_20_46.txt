So here goes my first post on reddit. I lost my grandma 3 years ago and I was really close to her. Long story short, my grandma had a stupid accident and she fell off her bike while trying to avoid hitting a kid that jumped in front of her. So she was rushed to the hospital, had brain surgery and after surgery she started feeling better.but after surgery i was looking at her and it wasn’t her. Her eyes were empty and I’m not sure if she even recognized us. She knew we were someone close but she looked really confused. After 2 weeks she went into a coma and after 2 days her organs shut down and she died. It was a hard moment but i accepted it because knowing her and how active she was, it would have destroyed her just laying in bed and not being able to do all the things she previously was able to do. So... 2 months after her dead, i was suffering from insomnia. One night, i managed to sleep for about 3h and then i woke up and I couldn’t fall back to sleep. I started reading shit online, i even played some sleep meditation to try to fall back asleep. Somehow I think I managed to fall asleep and I had a dream. I was in my grandparents apartment and I went in my grandpa’s bedroom and i wanted to take a nap. So i got into bed and on the bed was my robe. The one i had back then white with grey stars, you know those fluffy robs you wear around the house. So, i was sleeping in my dream and i felt how someone sat on the bed, grabbing my robe and tucking me in. Then i felt a hand on my shoulder and I wanted to turn around and suddenly i felt the smell of my grandma’s special recipe of ginger bread. I knew it was her and i wanted to turn around and i hear a whisper saying “It’s ok”. Then i woke up and my whole apartment smelled like ginger bread. It scared me but in the same time i felt calm. :) so this is my story for you guys. Please share if you felt something similar
