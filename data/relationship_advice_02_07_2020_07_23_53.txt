I’ve know “Sarah” (fake name) since kindergarten and we were really good friends all throughout school, we reconnected after highschool and now we’ve been together for a year and a little bit. I’m in college and nearing the end of my 3 year program, and I’ve always wanted to be with someone who’s at the same point in life as I am. When I started dating Sarah she had a job and was planning to go to school, she quit her job since she wasn’t able to balance school and work which annoyed me. I’m in a full time program and work 30 hours a week, I ended up paying for everything and it’s put me in around 11 grand in debt (a lot of that is my impulses but a good chunk was spent on her). She failed out of school the first time, she made it maybe 3 months and gave up. That’s fine, I understand. She then took an online program instead, still not working, so she sits at home all day. I then find out she’s taking half semesters, 3 courses. Pretty easy right? I always reached out and asked how school was going and if I could help, but she always got super defensive and told me to stop being her “Mom”. I learnt last night that’s shes been lying to me for a while, as she’s failed every course in her last semester. Her parents are going to throw her out when the find out, she’s got no job, I can tell that her survival plan is based on me. This isn’t the first time shes lied to me about something, and it’s weird cause there was no way she was going to keep it from me forever so why lie in the first place? So I’m conflicted, I don’t like being lied too. Now it turns out she’s literally been watching movies all day doing fuck all while I’m working my ass off. Our plans in life were based off of the fact that we’d both graduate. She’s also missing her highschool diploma too. (She’s not dumb, she tested into college and uni just fine) what do I do? I’m hurt that she lied and my future has been turned upside down
