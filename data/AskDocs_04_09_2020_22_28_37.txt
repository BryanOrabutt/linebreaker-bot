Hello I have been bouncing from doctor to doctor all over florida trying to figure out this issue and so far I have gotten basically nowhere. so I figured reddit would be worth a try. It all started march of 2017 I had gotten out of a 2 yr relationship and started sleeping with a few girls to cope with it (yeah ik not a good idea) and the morning after a sexual encounter with a female I had lost the ability to have an erection out of completely nowhere, I was scared and confused and had no idea what was wrong with me. I went to the doctor right after and was given a checkup and urine test and they found I had chlamydia and was given medication to treat it, not too long after I had started taking it I felt better and could get erections, after I finished the medication I was cured tested and was good to go. But shortly after that i slowly continued to gain my symptoms again and had problems getting an erection, i could get morning wood in the morning and then the rest of the day i would have 0% sex drive or hint of an erection or anything, even with heavy stimulation I could barely get one and it was very hard to cum and when I did cum it was only a tiny amount now fast forward today I dont ever have morning wood  and it's super hard to get an erection and keep it I've had many MRI's on my pelvic area, cystoscopy and ct scans and all they've found was a small prostatic ultricle cyst in the midline and I'm also experiencing aching sore pain in my rectal area which idk if bowel diseases could play into ED. I've seen so many doctors who keep telling me all this is in my head but I cant imagine how that's possible I live a healthy life with no emotional trauma I workout all the time and am in great shape with a 6 pack and I have wife who I've been with and been faithful to for 2 years and 3 months so please tell me what could possibly be wrong with me anything will help I leave to air force basic training in 2 weeks and could really use some piece of advice to help me have piece of mind.
