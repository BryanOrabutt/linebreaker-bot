Okay so he’s 32 I’m 25 we both live in a giant city where COVID 19 has taken over but we have been dating before it did. My dad lives with me, as in I have an essential job and I pay for most of the rent, my dad pays for like 30 percent of the rent and the phone bill. I pay 70 percent of the rent and the food and I’m happy to.  We are all from Latin America although he’s straight from a LA country I’m American born and raised, my dad is also LA born but obviously as an American Latina I have different thoughts versus someone straight from Latin America. So he’s traditional, pays for everything, pays for my coffee and food at work. But okay so he sent me a screenshot of our convo on WhatsApp because I didn’t respond fast enough and I notice he has a picture of famous Mexican actress as his WhatsApp background. I already had told him to take that shit off. He says that I haven’t deleted photos of my ex from my phone and I’m just like they’re old photos from years back but they’re not my current WhatsApp or background pics what the fuck and I’ll delete them but it’s just pictures of him doing nothing and it’s def not a background pic on my phone. His reaction is to send me more pics of the actress saying “I would love to go out with her” I start flipping out insulting him, calling him every name in the book, he gives a half added apology I start making fun of him for that BS apology he FaceTimes me and I start crying and I live with my dad so my dad comes to me and he’s like are you okay?! And I’m just like “he sent me pics of another woman!” Yeah I guess it was immature but I was really hurt he would do that when I was already hurt so my dad starts yelling at him and saying to me “he’s obviously not worth anything you’re beautiful, young, you work so hard” and my dad is trying to get a look at his face so he hangs up. So he starts messaging me all apologetic but I’m just like you’re embarrassed cause my dad humiliated you but you didn’t care when you were making me cry and humiliating me in front of my father. Of course I send my friends screenshots of him sending photos of the actress and my friends are like wtf that’s not acceptable. And so he’s like i deleted all your nudes cause I don’t want you to be upset I’m like you idiot the whole point is that you not have any pictures of other women but clearly my nudes are more easy to rid of than other women so I just keep insulting him telling him that my friends and my dad hates him and he’s like I don’t think I deserve any of this. Im just angry saying he deserved every insult he got from me and my friends and that’s he’s only upset because he had a man (my father) insulting him because he didn’t seem super upset when I was crying on my own. What do y’all ladies think? He said he wants to be with me that I’m beautiful and kind and that he’s sorry he acted like that in the first place but that he didn’t deserve to be humiliated by my friends and dad and I’m just like.......you only felt bad cause you had a man telling you that you’re worthless cause you weren’t upset when I was crying only when my dad came over screaming at you on FaceTime 😂
