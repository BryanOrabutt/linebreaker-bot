Ok so today I went to get my hair cut. So normally I just go in sit down and get my hair trimmed. But today, when I went in the lady that does it said I needed to have it washed first. So I felt like I didn’t have a choice and I didn’t want to just say no, I go in to get my hair washed now it’s a different person doing it, and I’m already really anxious about get my hair trimmed but now it’s being washed with shampoo. I’m have anxiety really badly about chemicals and I have only one brand of shampoo I’m ok with using. So I lean my head back and the person pours on a shampoo which I didn’t know she was going to do, because I had never done this before. She  starts scrubbing it in and I’m freaking out on the inside because I’m afraid the shampoo might have cetyl alcohol in it which I’m not for what so ever. Some even got splashed on my face. Finally she is done and just hands me a towel. I’m dying on the inside because I guarantee that shampoo had cetyl alcohol in it. I go back over to the chair where I get my hair cut and I see the person who cuts my hair finishing someone else’s hair cut. I sit in the waiting area for her to finish. When she does finally get done she calls on me to come over. I sit down and she starts and I realize instantly that she didn’t even rinse off the  fucking scissors. When she finished, I paid and left. I go home and begin freaking out like crazy. I know I need to take a shower but I don’t want to waste 3 or 4 hours on that because I had just taken one the day before. Plus I don’t have any shirts that are not on the hangers so that means I’m going to have to wash my hands a whole another time which will take at least 30 minutes in a freezing cold shower. So what do I do. I really badly don’t want to take a shower but I think I might have to. Please help is cetyl alcohol harmful to someone under 18. I really need some reassurances so thankyou for any and sorry for my poor grammar
