So this is my first post here and it may get a little lengthy, before this I had a semi decent amount of experience with psychedelics at least I had thought😂 I’d eaten an 8th of mushrooms maybe 12 times and done “acid” maybe 4 or 5 times with my old best friend. We’d never done mire then a tab but we’d made plans to, we ended up in a huge fight and after I bought the acid I decided to do it with another friend of mine, we dropped it downtown Spokane with no where planned out to go, we’d figured during the come up we could find a place to crash and have a good amount of time to enjoy the city. Honestly that was an incredibly bad decision the acid began to hit us as we sat in a McDonald’s struggling to use the wifi. We walked to the north town mall and by the time we’d got there I was having more intense visuals then I’d ever had before it was everything I’d ever dreamed acid would be. We ended up sitting in the entry way next to the book store legs out stretched obnoxiously just staring at a brick wall😭 I don’t know what my friend was seeing but all I could see was these giant faceless body’s sliding around in the bricks. Eventually we left the entry way because the mall was closing and the WiFi was just as awful there as sitting in the parking garage. As where sitting on the curb of the parking garage I notice that there’s fish all over the floor in an almost ying yang sort of Dynamic and slowly they all seemed to float away as if they had been spilled out and the water that had brought them swept them away. I desperately wanted to see smoke so we started this cigar but as soon as I hit it I felt like I was gonna puke so I just looked at my friend and threw it 😅 the ember bounced and then as I was wondering if any gas on the pavement could have caught, the ground erupted in a swirl of small glowing dots bouncing around me. Then they where gone. Eventually we got ahold of her mom and she said she’d be there to get us in 30 minutes. Around an hour and a half after that a mall cop approached us basically to tell us we couldn’t just loiter there, I panicked and trying to seem as sober as possible started trying to show him my phone to prove that we where waiting on our ride and they had just been flakey. I knew I must have seemed cracked out but when I heard my friend say at full volume “ I’m tripping so fucking hard right now” with the mall cop at most 5 feet away that we where fucked. Fortunately he just snickered and asked if we knew our names which honestly fucked me up hard because up until he asked I did know my name. Eventually he walked away saying we had 30 min before he’d be back. That when full ego death hit me, I was seeing little Beatles and soot sprites crawling out of the seam of the pavement along with giant Caterpillar’s and all kinds of spiders. I was petting a cement Column wondering if I was feeling it or if it was feeling me when I noticed these beautiful six legged salamanders all over just scurrying about, honestly they where the most beautiful things I’ve seen. Eventually the mall cop came back and honestly at this point I couldn’t communicate at all with him at one point I tried to run away but my friend was to high to stand so I just set the backpacks down and sat back down. Finally her mom showed up for us but I’d never seen her car before and I was so high all I could see was a blurry face and waving arms, my friend had no idea if it was her mom but we walked towards the car and got in. Thankfully it was her, I began coming down for a moment but after a while I couldn’t even understand what her mom was saying at all it was some Charlie Brown type shit just “wa la wa ha bijh g dfbbb” we eventually got to her grand parents and slumped out for the night but that’s the hardest I’ve ever tripped and it was just off a tab and a half. This all happened about 3 years ago and I’ve done acid probably 30 times now but I’ve never seen entire creatures again, any tips to get back to that high?😂❣️
