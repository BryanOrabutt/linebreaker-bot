Hello everyone, I have a small problem with my 2019 sportster 883. About 3 weeks a go I got my bike back from it’s 1000 mile service and they also switched the battery since it was having issues but 3 days after I got it back I was out for a ride and the bike completely shut off and died. Since the battery was “new” and switched I found it a little odd, I called Eagles nest I. LATHROP California and the woman who answered me told me a needed to get a battery tender so I did. After letting my battery charge for 3 days it finally started and ran fine, and I charge it when I’m not using it. The issue is, even though I charge it the battery light turns on every time I’m riding even if its 2 minutes after I started it and it won’t turn off. I went to the store to meet up with my parents about 2 days ago and on my way back home the bike completely shut off about 2 miles from my house so I just decided to push it home. The whole time I was riding the light was on but I don’t know why. The bike had been charging more than 24 hours because I dod t use it the previous day so I honestly don’t know what to do. Times are tough right now and I do t want to take it to the dealer and get charged up the ass for something I feel they should have checked 2 weeks ago while they had it for a whole week. I’m 18 and fairly new to riding, I’ve only had my bike for 3 months and it’s been a blast, my dad thinks they are fucking us and making me spend a shit ton of money. I want to know if I’m doing something wrong or should be doing something to keep my bike healthy. I don’t want my dad to push me into returning the bike or getting it repossessed, payments aren’t a problem since I get paid good enough at my job but having to fix constant issues from $400 plus is. That’s more than my monthly payments including insurance. Please help me and let me know about anything I should need to know, or if you have solutions. Thank guys
