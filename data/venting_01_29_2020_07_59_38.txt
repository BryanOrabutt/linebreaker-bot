She will always talk to me while im on the phone. If I do it to her she starts getting annoyed and tries ignore me while she's listening to whoever she is on the phone too but is always doing it to me and doesn't stop talking to me (I only do this to her because she does it to me so much). She'll tell me about the cat or something and fully start telling me a story while I've got the phone to my ear. The MOST ANNOYING thing she does is ask me if the cat is inside or outside. I'll answer something like "I'm not sure I think I saw him inside" then she'll say "No I dont think so, I let him out 15 mins ago" and I'm just silently screaming to myself "SO WHY TF DID YOU ASK ME!?!?@?@" She does it EVERY time. Whenever she asks if the cat is in out, no matter what answer I give, she will already have the answer. The worst part is getting it wrong and her telling me 'No' because she already let him in/out. I can't explain how frustrating it is to have someone ask you something to just tell you no. The other thing she does is if I've come back from a night out, she'll ask me what time I got back last night. The other night this happened, my response was 11pm, her response was "No, I dont think so" and looks at me with a smirk as if she's caught me out or something. So I'll firmly tell her no I came back last night at 11pm. She'll continue to smirk and say no to me somehow waiting for me to break a smirk too like I'm going to give up the lie, which by the way, I'm not even lying. I'll tell her once last time in a raised voice no I came back at 11, I have no need to lie, why would I lie about such small thing like this? What do I have to gain from lying? She'll finally realise I'm telling the truth and then tell me "Oh I was asleep at 11 so I wouldn't have heard you come in" I'm just silently screaming to myself again "if you were asleep at the time I got back, how are you trying to tell me NO!?!?! ACTUALLY TELLING ME NO LIKE YOU WERE UP AND DIDNT SEE ME COME IN BUT THEN YOU ADMIT YOURSELF YOU WAS ASLEEP SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE TELLING ME NO LIKE 3 TIMES WHEN IM TELLING YOU WHAT TIME I GOT BACK!"
