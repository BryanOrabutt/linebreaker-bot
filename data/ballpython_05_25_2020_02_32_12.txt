First things first, I've had my BP on only mice for about a year now, and he rarely doesn't take those and has eaten all through the year. I tried to switch him from mice to rats a few days ago and he has not taken the first rat I have offered him. When I looked at his body language, he really didn't see the rat as food. I have foolishly already used up all of my mice and have none left. I want to point out a behavior that I've been seeing in my BP for the past 2-3 months, and he always goes around the lid of the tub I have him in, yet I don't see the error in his husbandry, and he has been taking food and has no bad sheds. I have recently cleaned his enclosure and this behavior persists. I wonder if he is not used to the rats or is too stressed. He isn't hissy or strikey at all when I handle him or when I try to give him food. I really don't want to have to get more mice to switch him to rats, but I'm afraid I might have to do that. I also want to know if my husbandry is incorrect. I have my 2yr old BP in a tub that is dimensions 21"x14" and 12" high. He has a heat lamp that is on from 8 AM to 8 PM, and the humidity is always from 55% to 65% (unless shedding). he has 2 hides on warm and cold side, hot spot is about 90-95 degrees F, always on. Ambient temp is hard to keep these days since his room fluctuates from 70-82 F, which makes it difficult to regulate temp. I had him for about 68 months with no heat lamp at all and just UTH before winter, when I had to get a heat lamp during the day. Maybe the temp fluctuation is too much? I don't know if he's stressed, but I'm not sure. I just want to get him onto rats and make sure my scaly boi is happy, and I hope I don't have to spend a lot more on mice if it can be avoided. Thanks for any advice that can be offered. And before you say it, YES I have tried turning him off and on again. Did not work :/
