I just recently posted here but am
Rarely on reddit to begin with but idek where to start well here goes: I met my friend (we’ll call her Tessa) on kik about 4-5 years ago at first it was just us sending memes to each other texting back and forth, etc. Eventually as time went on I developed a crush on her and about a year and a half later of us being friends I confessed my feelings to her she had nervously said she felt the same way and just didn’t know how to go about it but the problem was I live in California and Tessa lives in Tennessee so we decided not to try anything in the case that things don’t work because long distance the friendship would still remain and remain strong.  I can’t compare the bond we had because it was like no other I’ve ever had with anyone in my life so far we told each other EVERYTHING (no exaggeration) and it was basically like I was dating my best friend we had shared some photos with each other here and there but nothing crazy we told each other we loved one another but still remained friends, it was good I had even been talking about going with her to prom my senior year since she had told me she was coming to visit that year so I was beyond ecstatic... then life came around I got into a relationship with my at the time gf. I still cared for Tessa Immensely but explained to her that no one was to get in the way of our friendship and that we agreed we didn’t want to get into a relationship with each other as we didn’t want to hurt each other, so when told to choose between her or my gf I chose my gf she was a bit sad but we continued being friends and stayed close eventually I grew more attached to my gf and talked to Tessa less. Eventually Tessa being the beautiful girl she is, hot herself a bf which I will admit bothered me at the time but it hadn’t been the first time that she was in a relationship while we were friends so I didn’t mind too much that someone cared about her, that was until her bf decided to dm me some stupid messages asking who the fuck I was because my name was in her bio? I said I could ask you the same thing. He introduced himself as her bf and I Introduced myself as her best friend we then had a little chat and he had grown quite fond of me enough to include me in their gc on insta about becoming a US marine (she was into that). It was a little group of them within the chat but ever since her bf had messaged me that day I felt as though something was off about him but I payed no mind until it was brought to my attention by others in the group chat and her bf that she was CHEATING ON HIM?!? I couldn’t believe it but someone else who claimed to be her bf was commenting on her pics and iG no one knew until they dm’d the guy? Anyway all this goes on while she’s enjoying herself at the birthday party her parents threw for her so everyone’s discussing things in the group chat without her knowledge and it was then that bf decided to come up with an ingenious plan and that was to pretend that he didn’t know SHE WAS CHEATING ON HIM AND THEN SCOLD HER IN FRONT OF HER FAMILY WHEN HE WENT TO SEE HER? I of course saw many problems with that so I informed her about what was going on she calls me sobbing saying she didn’t want to tell me because she was afraid of what I would think as wrong as it was what she did she was my best friend so I told her that she should’ve told me and we could’ve tried to figure things out before they got to that point. Fast forward it’s the end of the night and bf is pissed (obviously) and decided that enough was enough so he cuts it off with Tessa and she was devastated because she was cheating on the other guy with bf so ig that was good for bf??  Idk but regardless her and I started talking because every one of their “friends” was on his side except me so we spoke and I tried my best to make her feel at ease it was then that when her and I began to get close again that bf and his friends began messaging me telling e to leave Tessa alone and that I’m “getting in the way of their love” when I brought the fact that HE BROKE UP WITH HER he said he had changed his mind and that he wanted to try things again (not to seem self absorbed or narcissistic but he didn’t like me very much after so I felt in a way he’d rather her be with him than with me at that point because I took her side) she still having feeling for him tried things out again and tried to remain friends with me despite him hating my guts. Eventually they would break up because of me literally they would argue about me and how I’m getting in the way of their relationship and what not and I honestly had no idea what to do it was then that her and I stopped talking because of her bf. Fast forward again she hmu because she didn’t want the friendship to end but she doesn’t want to break up with this guy and we try to remain friends only for it to fall flat because of her bf and all his childish friends he would threaten to beat the shit out of me despite being 2 years younger but apparently him being in ROTC means he’s capable of anything. I then message her later on in time and she fills me in on what’s been going on. Apparently my suspicions about this guy were right because from everything she told me he was manipulating her this whole time always playing the victim whether it would be calling her names or bringing her down or when he would scold her for having male friends and force her to block them but when she asked the same of him about his female friends he refused he would even post pics of other girls nudes that he would receive In the gc Knowing HIS EX SEEING EVERYTHING people called him out on it but really no one cared about her feelings she told me all this and how she was going to break up with him if something like this happened again and it did so she did what she had to do. I thought finally I can have my friend back but NO. He then tells all his friends that since the breakup which happened no less than 48 hours ago that he’s began “drinking” and that he won’t stop until he’s dead blah blah blah basically playing the victim despite being the one that mistreated her. All his friends concerned messaged Tessa telling her the news I try to explain to her how it’s just bs but she feels bad and doesn’t want to feel responsible for a life as well as she most likely still had feelings for him The moment they get back together it’s back to complaining about WHY IS OP HERE?? I hate him so then we stop talking I then reach out to her idk what time this is now but I tell her look I really care about you and I just want to be on your life as friends and as she feels the same way she is hesitant because her bf is going to her mad if he finds out we’re talking so we message on messages and not insta because he has her Instagram we talk for what appeared to be a month and we continue getting close and closer we FaceTime more often and I’m finally beginning to think this time we’re going to be okay but then when I mention telling her bf we’re talking she is quick to reject the idea when I ask why she says he will get mad and it bothered me at the time because I knowingly told my past gfs that Tessa was a close friend of mine and that I wasn’t simply going to stop talking to her as we had been good friends for so many years so when i didn’t get the same back I was kind of hurt and eventually her and stopped talking because she became paranoid that her bf would find out about us talking and it ended with me saying don’t contact me but that was 6 months ago and I wanted to tell her that I was joining the military because she was honestly the first person I wanted to tell because I know she’s super interested in becoming a marine so a friend told me to just do things on impulse I messaged her telling her the news and she responded with that’s great I’m happy for you but due to past experiences I think it’s best you don’t contact me again and I said I understood and that thanks for the message but I honestly feel horrible I thought we’d be able to be okay again with time but now I’m just thinking is it too late ? Should I try to make an effort ? I want to but I don’t know if th hats the best idea which is why I came here because people will just be honest with me and not sugarcoat it which yea, hurts a lot hearing the truth but I feel like I kind of already know the answer but feel free to comment could use the advice
