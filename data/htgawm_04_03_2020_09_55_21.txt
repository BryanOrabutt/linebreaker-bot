I get that the whole show if filled with deplorable people with toxic behavior but GODAMN ANNALISE. ( I’m on season 2 ep4 as of now). She has got one hell of a victim mentality and is so fucking self centered. Poor me, my husband is cheating on me! Even though I stole him from his first wife and I also am having an affair with a married man whose wife is deteriorating from stage 4 ovarian cancer, poor little ol me. I was sexually assaulted so that means I have the right to spread toxicity around me and negates every bad thing that I do. And then when she was held as a hostile witness for Nate’s hearing she wanted to cry because the prosecutor was telling the truth, she was banging a married man whose wife was dying, all those repercussions she should’ve thought about before she got with him. She used him, framed him, hit him beat up and got his asshole searched because of her and she still wants to come back into their lives. Miss I can fix everything, even though this whole series could’ve been avoided if she had just done the right thing and gave the phone as evidence, actually did her best with Rebecca’s trial like every other case she gets so proactive over but not this one, even though she clearly knew he was guilty. Rebecca would’ve not been pushed into a corner to go along with Nate that led her to the house and in turn the K4. Yes Wes whacked sam’s head however it was because he was clearly trying to kill Rebecca, it was in self defense, Micheala is such a squeamish frightful girl of course any person like that would instinctively shove a violent pursuer away. Connor helped clean up the body cause he had to or else the rest would also say he took part, who else was there to say he didn’t? She totally uses and manipulates people like she did eve and Nate, she totally led Eve on, when she finally told Annalise she was going to get over her she kisses her and initiates,once again,the rekindling of an old flame, even after Nate’s trial. She told her it was something “real” and when to tell someone that at a vulnerable point in their life’s you sure as fuck better mean it. Sorry if there’s any grammatical errors it’s 2:50 on the morning and I just needed to rant. Not enough people talk about how problematic these characters are, I’m only watching at this point to find out the end, wish I never started watching this blood boiling show 😫
