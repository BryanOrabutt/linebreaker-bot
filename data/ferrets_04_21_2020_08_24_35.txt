Hello so I’ve got a 3 month old male ferret a little over a month ago. I have 2 girls both over a year old almost 2! He started off as a very good boy, introduction went smooth! After like 3 weeks he been biting a whole lot more (understandable) so we’ve been scruffing him telling him no no (no yelling) the usual punishment to help him understand it’s a no no basically. So that’s all going alright, same with litter training. But what I’m not sure what to do is he seems to be aggressively playing with my girls and they play back and all but after awhile the girls get tired but he never leaves them alone and I feel bad I don’t know how to give my girls rest time but keep him occupied or to relax him. He will drag them around while trying to rest and they don’t seem to like it but not mind it so much at the same time sometimes. Even at bed time, never leaves them alone. So we finally quarantined him with the top floor of our ferret nation cage! Was fine for a bit up until all of a sudden he digs up the litter box and food bowl (or just everything out of anger or for whatever reason if there isn’t any reason.) every single night and proceeds to poop in wrong corners(which he was really good about pooping in litter box at first and now he won’t)! And it’s like a bomb went off and we clean it all up every morning. And repeat. So lastly we got my older single floor cage to keep him in so it’s not so messy all the time and he’s fully quarantined! I feel like that isn’t going to obviously correct this but we are training him on litter box and biting. Moral of story I’m looking for help on how to help train him not to be so aggressive even while they are trying to rest at night AND how to get him to stop digging up litter? I know this is long but I like to explain throughly my situations and what I need help with so you get the scenario! Thank you!❤️
