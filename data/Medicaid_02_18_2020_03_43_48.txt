I am on Iowa Medicaid. I have been on it since 2016 and still present on it. They do a 5 yr look back next year for my 5th yr on it and I am not sure how they do it where I have to apply again or if they renew me? I am on a cycle where I am renewed every year. I am nervous about it because I make $13,000 and or less each year. I have several mental illnesses, disorders and intellectual disabilities where I need to be on Medicaid to pay for appointments. It is difficult because all of the services I get are not helping with any of my illnesses and I went to several doctors, therapists and etc and nothing seems to help me progress to get better. I do so much trial and error so I get no where wear the services dont help, but I dont wanna give up on them and need to have Medicaid to find the right help, but it has been very difficult. I have a savings account that I had at the beginning of  2016 with $20,000 in it. I am not sure if I wrote/gave that info to Medicaid when I first applied, but they still accepted me. Is there a way I can find what I wrote on my application to see if they check my bank account or what statement I gave them because I dont remember? Do they check my account every yr when they renew me? I want to pull the money but am afraid they will find out I pulled it from checking with bank cuz they can look back on past statments. I also know for the rest of my life I will make around the same income, but by me having that much in savings makes it look bad but I dont wanna get rid of it to spend it down and then I will be poor, but with my illnesses it is hard to work and function in life and I cant get disability cuz I know Im not eligible for it and have issues there. Will I get it trouble with medicaid? Hoping someone can answer some of the questions above if they made sense. Thank you!
