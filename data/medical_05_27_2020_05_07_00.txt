I’m a 16 year old guy who worked out quite a lot before Covid-19 and the quarantine. I boxed and lifted 4-5 days a week. About a month before quarantine I started to take a break from boxing and lifting because my body started to crack a lot, mainly behind my shoulder blades, my lower back, and my all around my neck. So after a lot of waiting it didn’t go away, so I went to the doctors and they said it was most likely from lifting too much weight. So they suggested I get an X-ray just to make sure I’m ok and told me it should go away if I lift lighter weights and don’t lift as much. So the x-ray showed everything was ok with my bones and so I ended up just not working out at all or boxing for a while. The cracking of my neck and back continued. So then I went to a chiropractor and told him all about how I was feeling. He then gave me an “adjustment” of my neck and back, and a little massage. I then went home and felt... the exact same way. I really wasn’t sure about what to do and my parents didn’t know either. So then the quarantine started and all gyms closed down. I was really hoping by now several months into quarantine that it would be gone. But my neck and back still crack all the time. If anything it’s gotten worse after all these months of sitting inside. All the time I feel the need to turn my head and bend my neck and move my upper body all over the place, just to feel a little crack. So if the doctors can’t figure it out and chiropractors won’t help then what do I do. Not even google can help me out at all. I mean it says see a chiropractor but clearly that doesn’t work. So I’m really stuck here, it makes no sense I’m fit and have a really good build. I don’t think I overworked myself by lifting too much at all honestly. I really need someone to help me out right now. There has got to be someone who knows what’s wrong with me or has had similar problems. Cause I can’t be the only person on the planet to feel this way
