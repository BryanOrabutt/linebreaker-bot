I'm really frustrated and lost right now. I'm struggling so badly to be productive. The stuff I need to do during the day like attend online class and take notes I get done but it's so hard for me to focus otherwise, and I'm retaking a class this quarter that I can't fail this time around. It's like no matter what I do, once classes are over for the day everything takes so long and so much effort to do. I can't focus for shit I sit down to work and it's like every five minutes my mind wanders off and then I blink and I back at my desk 15 mins later nothing done. Like constant intrusive annoying asf daydreaming. I keep forgetting assignments even though I have alarms set and a calendar on the wall w everything I need to get done. And god the amount of procrastination. I don't even know that it's necessarily lack of motivation I just CAN'T FOCUS. I'm so fucking tired. It was easier in hs bc there was so much less to keep track of and teachers gave constant reminders and second chances and then college came and it was way tougher and now it's online and it feels impossible. I feel like I'm barely scraping together what I need to get done and even then some thing's I'm not getting together at all, and I could do better if I was less unfocused and better at time management. I feel even when I do work for hours I barely get anything done, **especially** on the weekends. I wanted to try to fit in way more extra studying and practice probs etc bc now I'm at home and there's nothing else to do but it's like there's no organization to my anything and everything takes me so long I don't do the extra studying that could earn me the slightly better grade I want. The class I should be doing the most in is still the class I'm doing the least in bc usually when I get extra work done it's just for the classes I actually like bc I understand what I'm doing in them and they're more interesting so it's easier. Even this is a procrastination but idk I'm so fed up. What do I do????
