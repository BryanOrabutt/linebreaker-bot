I tried placing an order on the app so I could take advantage of the buy 2 get 1 free offer. When I got to the payment screen I saw that I did not receive a free sub. Which was disappointing but I assumed the location I chose was not a participating location. I then accidentally hit the back button instead of the add new card button. It took me all the way back to the main screen and showed no recent orders. So I thought the order had been lost. Since I wasn't getting the free sub anyway I decided to go inside and order. When I got to the counter the gentleman asked me if I placed an online order. I told him I tried because I wanted the free footlong but the app erased my order and since I didn't get my free sub anyway I came on inside. He said no you have to order online to get the free sub. I again told him how I tried and he repeated himself stating that I had to do it online. It was like Abbott and Costello's who's on first skit but in a Subway. So I said never mind I'll just stand over here and place the order online again. I went through all the same steps and got back to the payment screen. As I'm pulling my wallet back out to update the payment he questions me about the online order he is just finishing making. He asks if that's my name and my order and I say yes. That's when I realize that now the second order has been placed and it's finally showing on my screen. Both orders placed and the wrong card has now been charged twice. Neither time giving me my free sub. To make matters worse I find out that he has run out of Italian bread so he chose wheat for all the sandwiches instead. I asked him to remake mine which he did but then he argued with me because he wanted me to pay for that sub as well. Just making the already terrible experience I had an even worse one. Customer service is closed and the online options do nothing to help me. Is there anything I can do?
