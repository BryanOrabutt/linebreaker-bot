  I had a dream a few hours ago. I woke up 8 hours ago, strangely cause I had slept only 5 hours, then I went back to bed for sleeping a bit more. And then: I'm in home with my mother, is not the normal home where I lived with her in my childhood, we lived in 3-4 different houses but this one was something like a mix of all those, and different in the same way. The thing is a have a theory here: BEFORE GOING TO A LUCID DREAM/PARALLEL UNIVERSE, YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST DREAM/SPACE YOU'RE IN, IS COMPLETELY NORMAL, THEN YOU UNCONSCIOUSLY USE THE FIRST DREAM/SPACE TO ENTER THE SECOND DREAM, PARALLEL WORLD.  So then, the first dream, the house of my mother was completely normal except for having a big hole in the wall, with a little wardrobe door, very similar to "Being John Malkovich"I told my mother, " I need to go into this, need to see if everything's solved" and then I wen into the hole, it has a little steep and when you climb it you fall into a deep space. In a glimpse I'm in a gloomy but not dreadful place, full of people dressed very differently, some lay around, some walking, some sitted and playing cards some in benchs. They all seem to be waiting for something, this is so fucking real and vivid. It seems quite dark, but not naturally dark seems like a subway station with low lights but in outdoors, difficult to explain. There's trees where the wall of the subway would be, but there's a wall sometimes, with archs entering the forest. So then, instead of a railway on the line of the "road" there's a river, a dark, green river, moving quite pleasantly, almost seems a lake, at the other side of the river there's an landscape. Oh my god... I thought, I've seen it before!!! In a dream!! So then I had a glimpse, a feeling that I always felt in my vivid dreams, I cannot be reabsorbed back to the reality, I must stay in that dream... and then I went back to my bed or to the first dream....  But today all has changed, I realized in the dream that I wasn't in a dream, that wasn't a dream, I have been accessed to another reality, that I really know, but I just didn't remember cause of the travel "conscious-lag" so to say, but that was REAL AS FUCK, AS REAL AS REALITY, THEN I REALIZED SO STRONGLY THAT IN A WAY I FELT FEAR FOR BEING REABSORBED BACK TO "REALITY" BUT... I MADE SOME KIND OF MENTAL EFFORT AND I STOOD.. THERE, COMPLETELY REAL, COMPLETELY HD WITH EVERYONE ACTING COMPLETELY NORMAL, TALKING AND BEHAVING LIKE ABSOLUTELY NORMAL.  I saw a girl laying in the ground, close to a bench, She looked at me, seems like my girlfriend but a bit different, I consider her attractive but not sexually attractive, more like a friend attraction kind of thing. She stops looking and sort of waits for me to get close to her, like with a knowing look that she cannot make so evident. I doubt but finally I get close to her, she stands up quickly kiss me quickly and turn around and tell me: let's go please. Come with me. I follow her so amazed by this fact and I told her: "I need to tell you something, I KNOW THE SECRET, I KNOW THAT WE CAN GO INSIDE OTHER REALITIES THROUGH DREAMING, SO I KNOW THIS PLACE, AND I FEEL I KNOW YOU SOMEHOW..." she looks at the ground, smiles and says, "yes, that's how it is.., I feel happy that you're in and you noticed"  Then I Don't remember exactly, she writes something in a paper, something about coming with a car a honda or something like that, she needs to go around to pick the car, or something like that. And keeps the paper. Then I told her, "I need to come back" "I will try to join you back but.." and then things start to blurry a bit, IÂ´ve found another entry like the one in my mothers home but the steep is longer and higher. So I just came in and appear in my mothers home, with the paper she wrote.. but her wasn't there. I was so amazed, feeling that I could come back there whenever, but then I start thinking about the hole, and then I start realizing that THE PLACE THAT I WAS WAS A DREAM TOO BECAUSE OF THE HOLE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I REALIZED THAT WE NEED TO BE FOOLED BY A LIMBO DREAM (THE FIRST DREAM) TO ACCESS THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE. To be honest with you, I believe, since today, that dreams really do create portals for our consciousness to access to another REAL world. Where in space time is that? No idea, but is so real man, I had a very essential feeling, of belonging, of being there, pure recognition. This is so serious, probably some of you have felt and experienced something like this.
