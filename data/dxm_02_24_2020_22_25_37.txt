Hello world, so at Saturday I went to a friend's house, in front of her house there is a pharmacy and I had already planned to buy dxm, so at 5pm we both went to the pharmacy and bought dxm, my usual dose is 300 but  I decided that since I was going to mix with LSD, it had to be less, then we returned home, on Saturday morning I ask in this same reddit sub if someone had already mixed LSD and DMX before and if they could tell me how it was,  and some people advised me to take the lsd first and wait 60/120 minutes to take dxm, a friend was going to bring the lsd to my friend's house, I didn't take the dxm and i wait for until 6:50 pm that my friend arrive with de lsd and I took it at 6: 55 / 7pm and we went out to buy cigarettes and some shit,at the store the lsd began to hit, actually it was very fast, it was like 7:30 and I starated to get dizzy and then i laugh while I was paying the cigarettes,we left the store and outside the store i turn on a cigarette, a friend asked me if I was already high, to which  I said "wait" I looked at the wall and yes, I was breathing,never on lsd a wall breath that.... intense? If i can said lime that, visuals were soo soo intense and vivid,then we get back at my friend's house and I didn't remember the ecistence of the dxm in my bag until 10pm when my friend asked me "did you take the dxm?"  I had not taken it and I began to doubt if it had sense to take it if the peak of the LSD almost done, to which a friend told me that it does not matter because I could return, so I took it already 40 minutes later,  well, I did not know very well what was happening and I started laughing of everthing that my frinds said, then I tried to send a voice note for WhatsApp to a friend and it took me 3 minutes because while I was talking, I repeated what i said, I started to laugh  for no reason or I forgot what I was talking about, I finally managed to send the voice note,then i try to answear all my messages from WhatsApp,a frind in a grupo asked my before if i was okey,at what i answear with a vocie note "yeah,I'm thirsty" and i drank half of a bottle of 1.5 Liters,and then i went to the bathroom, it gave me a crazy diarrhea, that was when I asked right here what I could take and almost everyone told me that pepto bismol will help and it is totally safe, which worked and not It affected the trip, then I washed my hands and well, I have my nails painted pink, purple and blue, and while I washed my hands, very small spots began to appear on all my hands the color of my nails, I began to get kinda anxious and i scratch my hands  take them off, then i washed my hands about 5 times until that my friend went to the bathroom to check if I was fine because it had taken me 15 minutes,i didnt realize that i were theare that long, I told her that I could't wash my hands and she said "you have nothing,they are okay" and I insisted "I have purple, blue and pink spots, to which  she who had only taken dxm and half of an edible, told me "you have nothing, it's just the lsd, everything is fine" I calmed down and we left the bathroom and asked me "hey have you heard music with headphones on lsd?"  I said no and he said "try it" she lent me hers headphones and i put on a playlist of mine, and wow,i put on the song of Polaris de ghostemane, who at first heard a few drops of water falling, it was heard as the sound made  echo, it was very nice, after a while a friend said "I'm going out to smoke in the yard" to which I told him "i go with" bc i wanted a cigaratte to, we left the room and when i were walking, well in tje hallway, floor has  black and withe squares, while walking I felt that I did not vere moving forward, the floor was the one that it was moving, like a treadmill, we arrived  to the kitchen and from there we went out the back door for going outside, the back door is like dark wood and it looked so beautiful, it had many stripes of red, green and orange colors, we opened it and it was all dark, I could see absolutely nothing  but i was hearing a song,but theare was not any music,i looked to the sky and the stars that were seen in many colors,and the mon had like a rainbow aura, my friend turned on the light,i turn on the cigaratte and the smoke was kinda pink, it was cute, the grass breathe and the trees were like dancing, it was very nice, then i saw  my friend's dog omg that dog has a cool vibe, after a while we finished smoking and went again at the house, when we passed through the kitchen at the table there were some tablecloths with green flowers , but from a distance they seemed like blue letters, then I saw the window curtains that also had flowers rainbows, then I went back to my friend's room not before finding hers mom sleeping on the couch,in my friend's room while we talked we listened to music and I was watching her books while letters moved, then I started to see her wall, the patterns looked so nice, her table and her floor too, then it started to dawn and we decided to try to sleep, she fell asleep immediately and I after an hour at 7am  while I was lying down in her bed and watching  the window,i feel sleep, by the way the next day I got up shattered and i wake up at 3,my frinend and i take breakfast at 4 and i went back to my house,i watch a movie i eat some pasta and i feel sleep at 6pm.
