   How do you cope from  loneliness that results from this disorder? What do you do when your illness has driven everyone away and you have absolutely no one there? By that I mean no support of any kind: no family, friends or even therapist. I spend every day by myself, there’s nobody that comes over at this point and no one to call when I feel unstable or in need of support. Basically I have to cry it out everyday and cope  alone. It has been like this for the last six months since my ex left and Has gotten to the point even basic self-care is starting to elude me.  I’ve had a rotting tooth in my mouth for the last month, I struggle to even get dressed and sometimes have no desire to even do things as simple as eat. I’m lucky at this point if I nosh every couple days because really what’s the point? The hospital helps obviously  but I have to work so it’s not an option that can be utilized constantly. I don’t date because I don’t have the energy and tend to isolate myself because I cannot put on a happy face to be around people. The few friends I have been able to make I have freaked out and scared off if I got to close. They either felt overwhelmed by my situation or felt smothered by my clinginess and desire for emotional support. This is not something I did on purpose or intentionally… More that they were the only thing in my life and emotionally I was starving. So away they went too ....Then I would have to go out and find more friends in the circle just continued and continued and continued but now I’m at a point I no longer have the energy to go even do that because the search for people is  constant, And damn and I’m tired. I have hope that things will get better once I start dbt, In anywhere from a few weeks to a month and I also have you got a mood stabilizer… But in the meantime I guess what I’m asking is does anyone have any suggestions or ideas how to better cope ? Or at the very least how to not scare people off?
