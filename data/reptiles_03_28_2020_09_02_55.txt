Okay guys, in a group I'm in on a different site a guy posted a picture of a Ball that stopped me in my tracks. This girl is *pitiful.* I would share some photos but I'm negotiating her rescue, I've got him to agree to let me have her but he's already proved defensive about her and I don't want to screw it up. It would be my luck that he's a redditor. I'm driving several hours for this girl next week, I'd like to get her sooner but it took a lot of convincing to get dude to give her up already. He wants to wait until then so I will wait to save her if it keeps him from backing out. She's 4 years old and she is sooo thin guys. I wouldn't call her emaciated but she's close. She's got a gnarly burn scar on her side. It's healed but I doubt highly it was ever vetted and it seems like the scar tissue has caused a permanent bend in her spine but I won't know for sure until I have her. I'm told she's never had a clean shed and she's currently covered in stuck shed. Stuck shed I can deal with, not a big deal. I doubt anything can be done about the scar tissue but I'm open to ideas or correction there. Her weight I am very worried about though. I plan to have my vet check her out and I'm sure she'll have advice on the matter but in the meantime, what's the best way to go about putting weight on her? The guy says she only eats live. He swears she's a good eater but from what he's told me it's not often enough or big enough. Obviously I need to get her eating appropriately sized feeders but I'm concerned about it being live. She's too thin to wait it out trying to get her eating f/t, I'll work on that after I fatten her up. What's the best way to do that safely? Should I power feed her for a while? Twice a week if she's willing to take it versus once a week? Or do y'all think just getting her on a good schedule in general will be enough? Anything I need to watch for? I don't want her crashing on me, this girl has had enough hell in her life. Any and all advice is appreciated.
