so when i was 4 my older brother did things to me and honestly i don't know what to call it, I don't know if it was rape or abuse but either way he touched me in places that were private and he legitimately stuck his peen inside me multiple times and I didn't know what he was doing was wrong so I just let it happen, I didn't say no or anything. It took me forever to process what he did and i didn't realize it was wrong until 2 years ago. Its really hard for me to be comfortable around him even though we still get along really well and we actually have a lot in common. I just saw him the other day and we were talking and enjoying each other's company like nothing ever happened but there was still a part of me that hated him for what he did, nothing could rationalize the way he touched me and what he did was unforgivable, but hes my brother. I still love him and I just don't know how to feel about what happened. A part of me wonders if it even happened at all, it feels like it was just a weird dream I had that somehow affected my childhood. I grew up knowing about sex and I ended up having a porn addiction for the longest time. I just don't understand why he would do such a thing to someone who is so young. A part of me feels like my thoughts are irrational and all of this is being faked, it seems too crazy to be real. I told my mom about what happened and she told me not to tell anyone about it, and she started asking all kinds of questions and that made me feel like dying. i ended accusing my stepdad of trying to make moves on me even though he did nothing like that, I was the one who was all up on him like I was his actual child. I just got so paranoid that people were out to get me even though I just wanted affection so bad. I don't even know anymore, this post is so everywhere and I don't really know how to sort out my emotions.
