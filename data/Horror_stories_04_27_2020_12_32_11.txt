Yhyh I know that the title of this may come on a bit strong 😂 but seriously I was looking through my camera roll and I found a picture of me and my old roommate in our old apartment ( we aren’t friends now but that’s a story for another day ) 🥱 so me and my roommate let’s call her Jess were going to have a Halloween party like we did every year and this year I had a girlfriend so I was going to bring her with me. Jess was going to finish off just the little bits of planning we had left for the party like food when I went to pick up my girl. When I got back me and my girl came in and I saw Jess sat there staring at the wall and at first I was like oh it’s halloweeen she’s just being weird so me and my girlfriend wasn’t creeped out or concerned we just looked at her and laughed. The party went on and Jess still hadn’t moved so I told her to come and dance or to give candy out to kids and she suddenly got a nosebleed and this is when I started to get scared. I looked at jess and just said “you really went out this year” but Jess didn’t respond so I told my girlfriend that I was going to take her out for some air. I picked up Jess by her arms and I pulled her into our front garden. When we got out she seemed pretty normal she laughed and looked at me and said what time is it so I told her it was almost midnight and she started saying then what are we doing outside let’s go inside and get this party lit! I was so confused but just guessed she was going to be normal when we got back inside but instead she went in and sat on the sofa and stared at the wall. You see I really thought she was joking now because I just didn’t belive it but when I came back in my girlfriend came up to me and began to scream she was saying that I was cheating on her with Jess and that’s why I took her outside so I tried to tell her it wasn’t true and then Jess stood up looking emotionless cane over and kissed me in the cheek I was traumatised and began to scream at everyone I didn’t know what was going on. I was just about ready to punch Jess and propose to my girlfriend in a stupid attempt to make her know I love her. But that didn’t t happen. My girlfriend took her stuff and left I began to cry like the mature person I am and Jess sat back down and stared at the wall. the party slowly began to die and Jess was still looking at the wall so in a fit of rage I went up to her and screamed my head off telling her that this night was a mess and her joke wasn’t funny anymore and she turned to me slowly.. her eyes were lifeless... Yh she might of been wearing contacts but they looked real. I took a beer and went outside I needed to get my head right and I phoned my girlfriend and told her the party was still on and she should come back. She said no and I went back inside but the party seemed to be pretty over... my furniture was all facing the door were you would wall into the room and when I got in the music was off and it was only jess sat in a chair starting at me whispering I am pennywise the dancing clown this gave me chills down my spine it was only a few days ago we went to the cinema and watched the new It film and my room didn’t look tight the walls had splats of something up them and all the people who were at the party were gone and they didn’t leave because I would of saw them on my way back upstairs... I remeber going to my other friends house and sleeping there I can’t remeber if anything else happened that night but I moved out of jess’s appartment asap and am currently living with my boyfriend so ya if you want more things like this be sure to let me know
