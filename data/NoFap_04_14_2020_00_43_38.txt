I am 18 years old and i think i have stopped having morning erections ( if i had they were weaker) since i think august or at least that is when everything started happening. I had a surgery and i was under total anesthesia ( maybe it affects erections i dont know) and i noticed that my erections are weaker and last less and i dont have then as often as i used to. Only one or 2 years ago i was super hard every morning and after school  and had really really  hard erections and was always horny i guess and i felt like i would fuck everything. I stopped playing sports because I was not allowed to ( i used to be în the high school basketball team) and since the surgery i have stopped playing sports and got out of shape and a fit fatter. And i think that this is one of the reasons. Another obvious reasons is stress because of my final exams, but i am worried about something else. Ive been în a relationship for more than a year and we had not had sex. And i think that this is the reason. Shes afraid of sex, no piv no bj but this is not my main concern. Instead of sex, she likes to grind on my penis, basically pretending to have sex, but with clothes on. I was always blue balled after our round of '' sex '' and im afraid that by grinding and sitting on my penis, could she have destroyed it?  Like messed up the circulation of the blood floow to my penis and some biological and medical stuff or îs it all în my head and my penis is fine? I am not în the constant mood for sex like i used to 2 years ago but i  can still get hard, rarely really hard but not like before. I noticed that cardio helped me but the gyms are now closed because of corona and i think ill go to a doctor after the pandemic. So, what do you think, could my ding dong be broken or îs it mentally?  Please dont judge my relationship, thats a problem for another day
