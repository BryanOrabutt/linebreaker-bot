So........im about 14-ish and im......considerably mature but back on topic, time to time ill see.....these shadow people around my house, that sometimes look exactly how i did when i was incredibly young like 3 but the creepiest part is the theory my mom came up with, and keep in mind me and my mom are strong believers in the paranormal and so she came up with this theory the "Ethereal Paradox" she calls it where im the most perfect form of the being im designated to be and what im seeing is passed deceased versions of myself and my family due to me being the "perfect" form of that specific human, which i thought about it a little and it sounds a little out of wack but the deeper i thought about it the more it made sense because our knoledge is ever-evolving it could have been that im able to see passed versions of myself like a doppleganger or something and because its mainly connected to me, spiritually, only i would be able to see this phenomenon the absolute scariest experience i've had with this "ability" is i was sitting around in my loft/gameroom, i had the tv on and it was about maybe 1-1:30 am and i fell asleep but it was like when you blink and time skips, except with this it was like i had gained sleep paralysis but was completely calm it felt pretty strange, like if you had just been tazed and the adrenaline blocked out the pain and you were just sitting there, then i have to give you a mental image we have an open wall in the loft and then one side still with a wall just wide enough to fit a tv perfectly and we have this couch in the back of the room, this room isnt too big, and the couch could transform into a bed and to the right is a desk, so back to the experience i was in that "state" and couldnt move and i was in the like 90's girl texter her boyfriend pose where you're laying on your stomach with your feet down, pillow under chin, and hands around pillow and i was just staring at the tv in the state but then the phenomenon happened and i saw him a shadow figure that looked like me the disturbing part was he slowly decayed and got closer to grab the remote and shut off the tv, and keep in mind we have a smart tv thats broken and we couldn't get it fixed at the time so if you wanted the tv off you've gotta use the remote, then i woke up gasping like it was a lucid dream or something and i saw the remote moved onto the floor instead of on the floor where i had it but i just brushed it off as me moving it while asleep but as i was eating breakfast i noticed that there was nothing heavy enough in the room to push the power button precisely enough and point it at the tv to shut it off and i was in a state of shock, that me realizing i was just visited by this poltergeist, this thing, i haven't really told anyone other than my mom and brother and i thought puttinf this on reddit would've been a great way to get this off my chest, leave some thought on the comments on what you think about this, cause although it was scary as h*ll it was pretty cool to encounter something that rare, just wish i had it on camera
