hi all. i hope you are doing well. i had an interesting dream i would like to share and get an interpretation. so i had it last night. the first thing i remember was being in class. of course i dont go to school anymore. but i still have dreams about it very often. so i remember school was almost over. then before we were dismissed someone came on the intercom and made announcements. i dont know who it was or what they said. so i decided then that my new mission was to get on the intercom by any means necessary. so after all the students and teacher left i stayed in the room. i walked up to the phone that the teacher has on the desk. i look at it. and i try to find a page button. but there was none. i thought just great it has to be a code. so i typed in some random numbers but nothing. i realized that i was not going to get anywhere by doing that. so i got on youtube and tried to find a video of someone doing it at that school. i actually found a video with it. but it turned out to be a rick roll type thing. so i was mad. i decided to take my bike and ride to the town and see if i could get help. so automatically i was transported to the town of rhodes. from red dead redemption 2. only it was modern day. i walked in a party store and asked if they knew how to get on the intercom. they told me that there was a tutorial video of it. so i checked youtube and low and behold there it was. and it actually worked in the video. i got so excited i raced back to school. i got to the phone and put in the code. but it did not work. i scrolled down in the comments and it said that they changed it after the video was up. so i was pissed. eventually i gave up and i was leaving the building. and as i left someone got back on the intercom and said that i failed miserably and that i will never talk on an intercom again. this really hurt since that is actually my real life job is announcing. so i am wondering what did that mean? thank you.
