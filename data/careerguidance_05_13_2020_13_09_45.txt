So I recently got my first job in the field that I am in School for. I wanted a job in my field for months beforehand and once I found one I was super grateful. I appreciate the opportunity to get experience in my field, however things have started to turn a bit sour. I love what I do, but I can’t help but feel like I’m being taken advantage of. My boss is constantly asking me to do their personal errands, and pointless activities. From opening mail, to mailing things out for them, cleaning things, searching for misplaced items, etc. Things that make me feel like I am more of a personal assistant than what I took the job for. Then, the second I get to sit down and get the chance to work in my office, I am being overloaded with projects to the point where I can’t keep track of it all. I believe my boss thinks I don’t stay busy in my office (which is completely false). I’m not sure where this bias stemmed from. On top of it all, the thing that makes me feel the most frustrated is the fact that the other person who was hired for the same job title as me, has a completely different experience with my boss. We both started around the same time frame. We both have the same skill sets. Yet my boss doesn’t give them work, doesn’t make them run errands, and literally lets them get away with anything (she will literally tell her no or that she doesn’t want to do something and then I will have to do it). I go into work everything feeling tense and stressed. It’s like I can’t breathe when I am there. I don’t have a chance to just sit and recuperate because I am constantly being asked to do something. I feel guilty for feeling the way I do because I wanted a job in my field so badly and now that I have one, I already feel so bitter. Any advice on how to handle the situation? I am a very passive and anxious person, Maybe I have just been too nice.I just can’t help but feel like I’m being taken advantage of.
