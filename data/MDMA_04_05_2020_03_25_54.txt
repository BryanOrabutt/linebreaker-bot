The first time I took mdma was around a year ago now, it was amazing (green teslas for those who are wondering) I had never felt anything like it, I loved everyone, all my troubles were gone I was really in the moment, life couldn't be better, I met who I Consider to be my big brother that night, I didn't touch it for a couple months after that until my bro messaged me again saying he was having a party, I met a group of people who I connected with really well it was like my second family, anyway this led to us getting on pills every weekend, I took any chance I got to get on pills just because it made me feel human it took away all my problems I enjoyed every moment of it, I thought all the negative things with abusing mdma would never happen to me, I got myself into a toxic relationship with one of the people I met in that group which lasted until very recently, I was cheated on and all sorts it was Constant arguing and all that shit, anyways the pills continued until we couldn't get them anymore the group fell apart (mainly because the only thing holding us together was the drugs) I then started doing mdma crystal every month or so because I noticed I wasn't pinging anymore I just felt really cold and uncomfortable I felt like an alien in human skin if that makes sense lol, I ended up with psychosis and hppd every day was a living hell hearing voices and seeing "shadow beings" eventually something clicked and I stopped wanting to take mdma I still didn't realise the damage I had done, I met up with the guy who I saw as family after not speaking to him for months we decided to do some md for old times sake and during that roll I realised how short life really is and how I needed to stop taking this drug its like everything clicked that night, I ended up walking home which took about an hour. So about 2 months have gone by since that night and everything has caught up to me, mood swings, depression, insomnia. If you don't listen to the damn 3 month rule I promise you will regret it even if you seem okay and don't think its effecting you it really is, Serotonin takes ages to replenish you must give it time, I wish I could go back and change things but at least I can share my experience and hopefully stop some of you from making the same mistake I and hundreds of others have made, respect the drug but more importantly respect your body and mind. I know this post is a mess it's 4:30am and I'm typing this on my phone because I needed to finally get things off my chest but thank you for reading all of this for those who did thank you so much. BE SAFE HAVE FUN AND HAPPY SAFE ROLLING. MUCH LOVE TO ALL YOUS OUT THERE ❤️
