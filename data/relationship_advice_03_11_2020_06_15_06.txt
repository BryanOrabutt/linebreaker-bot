So me(25m) and my girlfriend(27f) have been in each other’s lives for about a year now, we’ve had our ups and downs like everyone, but when I first talked to her and we got to know each other we realized that we click, we get each other, it feels good when we are together and we do genuinely care about each other. Now she doesn’t drive because she has seizures and I realize that is a hurdle she has, I have Multiple Sclerosis myself so I get the way medical stuff can get I the way of a lot of things. I have finished college, and am working towards getting to the career I want. Her on the other hand is finishing her last class for her associates degree, working a entry level retail job, and doesn’t have her license. Now I’m not her to complain about any of that because I understand everyone does things in their own time and I do genuinely care about her, but I know her feelings are stronger than mine and I know the main reason is because over the last year I have seen her make no real effort to fix the distance between us ( I forgot to mention we live about an hour apart). I’m always driving to her and she’s told me her plans to compensate but has never followed through with any of them. Whenever I try to talk to her about it she throws it in my face and gets really annoyed and says “it’s not forever, you sound like your giving up. I try so much, I change my work schedule for you, I care so much, and your just giving up like that” and she gets really mad and then tucks it away and acts like everything is fine. I just feel like I’m not getting the same effort in that sense of the relationship and whenever I project it to her she gets really sad and makes me feel guilty. I’m getting tired of waiting and she doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to help fix what I see. I guess my question here is, am I crazy for feeling like this? Does anyone understand where I’m coming from?
