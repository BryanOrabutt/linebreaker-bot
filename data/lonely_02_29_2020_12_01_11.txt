Okay so, I’m 15 and addicted to fucking pills and I think because of that I lost the love of my fucking life, okay lemme explain. On Wednesday i was at school and I went overboard, I always take one in the morning but I just didn’t want to feel anything, I overthink a lot so whenever the smallest thing would go wrong between us I would  start overthinking and fall in this deep void where I need a pill to get me out, and tbh I thought xanax could help me just fall out of love, boy was I fucking wrong. First period(I was on one xan) I barely felt shit and I waited until second period and still didn’t feel shit, that’s when I went fucking ham and popped another xan, the went to the lobby and popped another xan. I don’t remember much but from what a friend of mine told me I fell like 8 times face flat onto the floor, and the girl that I love started asking why I took so many pills(she was fucking worried about me) and my dumbass told her to go fuck herself and took another xan then looked at her(mocking her) and took another one (5 now) at this point a friend of mine took my pills away or otherwise I would’ve been dead by now and to be honest that’s how I’d rather be if I’m not with her. She then texts me saying how things are gonna change between us(she was on her period so even worse) and I don’t even remember what I said, but I tried apologizing the day after(on Tuesday) but she told me that she still felt the same that she cares and appreciates me but not in that way anymore, I apologized yesterday too telling her that I was the one that fucked things up, I was the one that confused things again and that I was the one that acted like a fucking retard on Wednesday, she replied “Yeah it’s alright” “I love you fucking idiot” and tbh I couldn’t be more confused right now, I’m going to give her space because after all we’ve been through and all she’s said to me, I just can’t accept that she just changes with me again. On Tuesday when I see her I’m going to just stay away, I’m not gonna be a fucking dick and look at her the wrong way but I’m not gonna wait for her outside of the classroom like always(yes we’re in the same classes and that makes it worse) I’m posting this on here because I need advice, WHAT DO I FUCKING DOOO??If the vibe it’s all wrong next week and she actually doesn’t give a fuck about me, I’ll just off myself, not that she’ll miss me anyway.
