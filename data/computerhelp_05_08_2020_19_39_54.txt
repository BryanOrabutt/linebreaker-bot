Hi there. So I made a new Ryzen based build a few weeks ago, and re used my 7 year old 750w bronze rate Xigmatek psu for the build, as I presumed replacing it would be needless. Everything went smoohtly with the build until yesterday when I replaced the stock AMD cooler with a 212 EVO. In the process of putting the bracket in, I dropped a screw in the case. I tilted the PC around and gently shook it at various angles in order to locate the screw. To cut a long story short, I located the screw and finished installing the after market cooler. Thought everything had gone fine however my system failed to post until I took my 2070 super out and put in my old 970, which made the system run flawlessly. I'll also add that I snapped the retention clip off of the PCIE 16 slot in the process of taking out the 2070 super, largely down to the horrific design of the ASUS B450-M motherboard and the tight fit of the GPU in my case. The GPU has no discernible physical harm done to it however. I then switched the 2070 super back onto the board and low and behold, the system was now posting and got into windows as normal. I am however concerned about the fact my 2070 super now is making an intermittent low rumble (sort of like the sound of a washing machine spinning). When i press a stethoscope to it mid-rumble, you can clearly hear components within the gpu revving up. This sound is completely independent to fan speeds however, as it happens even when all three fans are idle on the card. I'm wondering if my 7 year old PSU is the culprit, or whether the GPU itself is damaged in some way. Temps and performance are all normal. I'm basically just paranoid about whether my old PSU is failing, and whether or not in the process of failure it could damage my rather expensive 2070 super. I guess I don't know which is the source of the problem, the PSU or the GPU! What do you guys think? is a new PSU in order, and do I need to be concerned about the health of my 2070 super? Thanks in advance.
