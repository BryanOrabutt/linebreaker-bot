There’s this guy that liked me for like three years and this was like back in middle school. I liked him back. We would stare at each other literally all the time. He would flirt however 13 year olds flirted back in the day. It was just a middle school crush. Cut to eighth grade. We don’t have classes together anymore. Then high school came. Same guy would still glance at me and stuff. At this point, things are like awkward between us. So so so awkward. Like tension all around. We would treat each other like exes even though we never even “dated” but yeah. I was in marching band and I remember him looking at me up and down and then laughing at me in a taunting way so I kinda realized oh okay. He’s making fun of me now. I’ll just ignore him and so I went on with my life. I guess that’s how things are now. I don’t see him much for the next two years. He dates my best friend but she breaks up with him after a week. Cut to junior year and I’m at prom with my friends. I can’t get through the door and someone lets me through. I look up to thank whoever it was only to realize it was him. Again, awkwardness. I knew he felt just as awkward as I did. Now I’m a senior in high school. I don’t see him much at all and don’t think about him either. Then all of a sudden I start having dreams about this guy. Not  romantic ones but just random dreams. Next day at school and all of a sudden there he is, just staring directly at me. Looking at me. I don’t know what’s up dude. Like this guy just has been popping up all over my life for the past 7 years and we’re gonna graduate in a few months. It’s 4 am and I’m just thinking about him. Not in a romantic way but more in a what the fuck way. I’m so so so so lost. When I think about it logically, it’s kinda creepy. But it doesn’t feel creepy. It feels more like, what is going on inside of his head. It’s like he’s playing mind games on me but he’s never talked to me after middle school
