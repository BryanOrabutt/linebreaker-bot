So I have a gut feeling if I continue to do the work I do, it'll render me pretty unhappy later in life, I am a welder and a painter, I work for a small company of maybe 20 people and we mostly make dumpsters and roll offs from scratch, I paint them and do several other things, this is my first job I've stayed for almost a year(my year is coming up next month) and may of last year the company was created, since then a lot has improved and its been very successful, there's a lot of opportunity for me and I'm trusted, respected and loved for my hard work, taking responsibility and being reliable, I also absolutely love my bosses the main boss is a woman named Cathy and she's wonderful and kind and super understanding and supportive of me and whatever I want to do whether it be leave or stay, I've talked to her, and her husband Patrick is second in command and he a strong silent type but he's super supportive and I've just grown and learned so much from this company, it's been a great opportunity to learn so much without having to go to school or pay money for training, but I don't find much purpose in my work and I feel like I go slightly unconscious during work, (not nearly as bad as other jobs I've had and this is why I've stayed here the longest) but I still just don't find a lot of joy in my work and it's like life starts when I get off, I work 4 10 hour days and have fri-sat off but i know there's something else I could be doing there has to be, so I'd like some suggestions on how I could find what's best for me or something I could try, school is expensive and I never made super great grades, but if I could go to school without taking pre requirements that would be more likely than not going at all, i really enjoy nature tho i feel like that's where my passion is stored just identifying specifically what I want is an issue. ALSO NOTE:i don't have anything really important out of work to make work more rewarding like I don't have a lot of bills, no gf, no kids, and I haven't found a hobby I'm super passionate about either.
