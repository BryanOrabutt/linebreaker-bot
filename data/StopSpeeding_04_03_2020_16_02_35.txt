Feel like I have left myself down once again after giving into using meth not even a couple days after making my first post on here asking for help and here I am a coming off another week bender resulting in me calling in sick to work today, and yet again here I am sitting up by myself trying to smoke the rest of my stuff so I can start fresh again tomorrow🤦🏼‍♂️ Can really start to feel everything taking a toll on my body and my mental state, for instance I’ve developed  a real bad sniffing habit when I get on it and it’s so excessive and it hardly gives me time to breathe and have had it turn into panic attacks which I first thought I was having a heart attack it was so intense and just feeling how fast my heart is beating at the moment it’ really can’t be good ! And Ive started to always find myself stuck mindlessly trying to squeeze blackheads and little impurity’s on my arms and face which end up looking 100x worst, I feel so ashamed afterwards when my parents see me like it and having to go into work for a week and without being able to hide all the red marks I’m left with, no ones ever brought it up but they would be petty hArd to miss 😒 Has anyone else gotten to the point where they have developed habits like these when they get on it. ? All I know is it all couldn’t be too good and I feel like I don’t have too many chances left at giving this shit up before it beats me!  I’m worried about how I’m going to deal with my social anxiety and stress (main triggers for me)after I give this up and I’m wondering if anyone can give me advice on what has worked in the past for them with getting in control of their anxiety whether it be medication or anything’, or if anyone has found that their anxiety has improved simply by getting off drugs in general ? I’ve always been to stubborn to want to have to take medication for it, but thinking now is the time to try anything that is going to help me... Sorry for another big rant I hope someone will take the time to read it I’ll be so grateful I need as much motivation and advice as I can get. I’m Going to set a reminder for 7 days from now and a month from now so I can come back here and hopefully be able to share my first sober streak in years & just as a way of keeping myself accountable. 👏🏽
