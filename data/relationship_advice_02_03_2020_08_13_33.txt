My toxic bf of two years didn't respect me, appreciate me, treated me like a piece of shit and basically I was the one who was giving everything to the relationship while he was just taking and not giving me anything back. Then I broke up with him, because I was fed up with how he treated me. He was so manipulative that he convinced me this was all my fault and I was to one who is supposed to change. So I begged him to give me a chance and try again, he said no and basically told me to fuck off. I was broken, because I still love him even after all the things he put me through. I went no contact after that ( three weeks ago ) , blocked him on facebook and made sure he is not following me on instagram. I just dissappeared. I started living my life to the fullest, reconnected with my friends, started going on trips we used to plan on going together, started going to the gym, finished my semester with straight A's. I changed and finally I was happy and I didn't give a damn about him. But we have mutual friends and they know almost everything about what I am doing and that I got over him. Yesterday I was at the movies with his brother, he was always very nice and kind to me so we remained friends and sometimes catch up. What he told me suprised me a bit. My ex told him to say hi to me with a "sad face" and that he hopes I am doing well. He told his brother he misses me and wants to see me. Then after that he watched my IG Story, because I wasnt private anymore and I was also on a trip in the mountains yesterday, where we were once together. He is not following me, btw. It all confused me a bit because three weeks ago he didn't want anything to do with me as I was begging him to come back to me and now that I am doing great he is doing all these things? Even after all this I still deeply love him, but I am not sure whether I want him back. Do you guys think he regrets losing me and now wants me back?
