I was coming back from work late one night sometime after 3am, was still in Cairo working for outsourced call center, to get home I had to take two busses which this late the first buss took a while to show up and then wait for all seats to fill with people and finally take off to it's route because that was the start of the route, however if you happen to catch a bus on route already then you can wave and it stops to pick you up then keep going, anyway I took the first buss and dropped to my stop where i waited for a buss already on route so I can stop it, I was carrying a bag where i have my headset for work which cost alot of money so you can't lose it, and my pay for the month which they give you in cash the first month until your bank account opens, I was tired and frustrated from work and just wanted to go home and watch my show, I was into Stargate Atlantica at the time, so I was waiting alone not a single soul on the street finally i saw a buss coming, it's color was red which was unusual normally they're white but I didn't give it much attention because if it was the wrong buss it wouldn't stop for me anyway so I started waving and running to catch it as it stopped for me, the door opens I noticed the buss was mostly empty which is normal this late however a guy comes down to let me up which was unnecessary as I could have just took the seat behind, and as I get in the buss I start realising the trap I stepped in, there was a guy sitting next to the window and then me and the guy who stepped down to let me in came and sat on my other side, each of them grabbed each of my arms to hold me down and at the front there was the driver and someone next to him who turned around to me holding a small sword waving it at me while cursing and demanding to give him everything I have, at that point time felt slow, I started feeling alot of mixed feelings,,angry that I missed all the clues and fell into the trap, helpless that I'm Completely held down and frankly have absolute no power on what's about to happen next, then I sensedÂ  some irony because the guy is asking me to give him what I have when I can't even move my arms, while all of this is going on I haven't said anything or done any movement or struggle, I was simply looking at him, listening and thinking and waiting for his next move, all of the sudden everyone started laughing, they let my arm go and said that they were kidding and asked where did I want to be dropped off, not being sure how to react I decide best way is to act normal, I smiled and told them where I'm going and reached into my pocket to get the money for the ride as I normally would and gave it to the driver however he didn't take it, said it's on them, I thanked him, and as we're driving they see another guy in the street walking by, the driver drove closer to him and matched his speed, the guy next to me asked him to get in while opening the door, the guy in the street "being smarter than I was" started running away and told him no, the guy next to me started going down and chased him but the other guy was faster so he came back to the buss and the driver tried to chase him, however the guy ran across the street to the other side of the road where the buss couldn't cross and got away, we continued on the ride, mean while I'm sitting there trying to make sense of what's happening and trying to act as normal as possible, the guys kept laughing and talking about how they scared him off, few mins later I was at my drop point and they let me go, I walked home thinking about the fact that not only I don't have a scratch on me when I thought I was going to die, or that I was going to lose a shit ton of money, but that I actually saved 1 pound which I usually pay for this buss, what a ride.
