We’ve been planning on getting married on April 11 for about a year now, we never really planned for anything big to begin with so luckily we don’t have to cancel anything. April 11 is important to us because it’s our anniversary, we’ve been dating 7 years and wanted to keep our anniversary the same! But along the way I got pregnant and there’s a whole pandemic going on, so we kind of just put getting married on the back burner. We would still very much like to get married this weekend and his brother is ordained and has agreed to marrying us. My fiancé has a very large family, while mine is quite small. We thought of only having parents come with us, but my mom has been a single parent since I was 5 and my big brother has been an important person in my life so I’d really like for him to be there (my dads not included with the parents btw). I feel like it would be unfair to him and his family if I had my brother and none of my fiancé’s siblings, so if we only have parents and siblings that brings our total to 10 people (including us). Am I just overthinking? Would it be “mean” for me to include my brother and not his siblings? Technically his brother is there also, but mainly because we need someone to marry us! And the other thing is that his younger sister is my best friend, so I’d like her there too but it’s not like I could just pick her and not his other siblings?? Sorry for this long paragraph- I get really anxious about things like this and don’t like disappointing or excluding people I guess? (With all nieces/nephews/So’s included it would have brought our total up to 20, so we have at least cut our total in half) I know the less people there the better, I’m just trying to do what’s safest for our families but also trying to include them. So honestly I don’t know what the point of this post is, maybe to get a little venting done, maybe to get a little advice. Saturday is only a few days away and we still have no idea what we’re doing.
