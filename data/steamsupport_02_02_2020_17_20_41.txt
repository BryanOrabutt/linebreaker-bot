Okay, so before you go roasting me in the comments about how dumb I am (this was very dumb of me) please read the whole thing. I was sent a link to some site that normally steam will flag as being scam. I guess this site hadn't been around for them to see it as a known scam site because when i clicked on it, it went strait to the site.  The whole premise of it was that "they wanted to give you a free skin". My original thought was that I would get a decent skin, then it would ask me to pay for it to get it. i was wrong. I won some M4a1-s skin that was decent, and instead of asking me to pay for it. It asked me to put in my steam username and password. I do all this correctly. And then it asks me for my mobile authentication, which I put in. THEN, it asks me for my email verification. (looking back on this now, I should have know that a real steam log in would have just stopped at mobile authentication. But I continued to put in the code it had sent to my email. I then watch as it logs me out of my steam account on my computer and on my phone. I try to log back into my account many times with no reward. I try the help section and see the forgot password section. I click on that thinking that me getting logged out was a mistake. I change my password and go to log back in. I get the same message again and again that I put it in wrong. I then choose the help section of my account was stolen. I fill it out and did it all correctly, i had my friend look at my profile because he had me friended on steam, and it said that I hadn't been online since I got logged out. I finished filling out my report and get the proper verification via my email. It has now been almost 24 hours since I first filled out my report and still not a word from steam. The only good part of this was that I only had around $18 worth of skins on my account. The worst part is all the achievements, time, friends, and rank that I have to gain back. Wish me luck please.
