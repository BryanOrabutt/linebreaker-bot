WTF? You say! It’s nonsense, made up, you have to shout it at the top of your voice, Keela Waleeka, in the house,  or even better, in the garden. You will feel better! It will release your tensions. Go on, you know you wanna. Shout it now, over and over in any silly accent you like. Add some movement, shake your body!    There, little rave over.                                                       Hi, I am me, Millenium Gran, MG for short.                        When I was 18, a very, very long time ago, I had a sugar Daddy! Sort of, well an older guy who kind of took an interest in me and helped me out. He got me a job with a builder friend who had just opened a new office. Well, a hut at the back of the yard, and wanted someone to answer the phone, do filing etc. I think he just wanted a dolly bird to perch on the typing chair really!                                                                          I made the tea, shuffled paper about and typed a few letters but in the first couple of weeks it was soooo boring. I began to realise I was to be more than just a dolly bird if you know what I mean. I did not go in on the following Monday or Tuesday. He rang me and told me “Don’t bother coming back!”) Well I had to pop in and pick up some stuff I had left there. No one was about so I dashed in quick, grabbed my stuff and also grabbed all the tea, coffee and sugar then rang up the milkman to cancel the milk. (Yes I am that old) . In my smug little 18 year old head I thought I had been real smart!                                  PS Markee, it was so nice to see your sweet face . I wanted to give you a great bit, hang social distancing, grandmotherly hug. X
