Hi there, this is my first post- I was wondering if anyone on here knew why my feet and legs were turning very very dark blue/ purple randomly? I’ve had this issue for a while but when I went to the doctors it was only my toes that turned purple and she gave me an antibiotic cream? I was kind of upset because I knew it wasn’t an infection (and I was right antibiotics did nothing) and I was not taken seriously at all. It doesn’t seem to be affected much by cold temperatures and even after I get out of a bath it’ll just turn red instead of purple. Whenever I press on the areas it turns white and stays white for close to a minute. I also have been experiencing a weirdly painful but kind of numb tingling in my big toes mainly my right. What drove me to be concerned after all this time of having these symptoms was the fact that normally it’s just my toes that turn purple but now below my knee turns a dark grape purple, it looks like one long bruise. I wish I could attach an image because it’s hard to convey how dark it is. I don’t know if this helps but from the age of 10 to 15 I experienced undiagnosed convulsive syncope 2 to 3 times a day that would be triggered by heart issues, I’ve been episode free for a year now but ever since this circulation stuff started I’ve been experiencing the same sort of palpitations I had that would trigger convulsions. It’s really worrying me because the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong before and I was hospitalized because I hit my head from passing out quite often. I know it’s probably not related to my circulation issues, but I figured more information is better than less especially since the heart palpitations started again once the circulation problems started. The palpitations certainly aren’t as bad but they are just very slowly starting to come back and it’s worrying me.  Sorry for the really long post, I wanted to make sure I didn’t leave anything out because I want to make sure it was good enough info. Thank you!
