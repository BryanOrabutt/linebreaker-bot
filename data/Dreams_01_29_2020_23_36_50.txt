Alright so I had this dream about a girl from a couple years ago. We were with a few of my other old friends and we were all playing tag in the woods. (Keep in mind that this woods had train tracks and dirt bike/four wheeler trails) the main focus of this dream is the girl who was it. No matter how hard I focused on her face I couldn't make anything out other than her glasses and white hair. But I could still tell who it was. She was it and was chasing me deep into the woods. We ended up at the train tracks. I ran across the tracks and safely made it across. But when the girl who was it (who I will call Savannah) ran across a bus from out of nowhere ran her over. She let out a terrible high pitched scream. When I turned around her body was completely decomposed and missing her eyes. I started to cry and I ran away. I went to her house to tell her grandmother what had happend. All my friends disappeared and i was alone. I felt something crunchy and dry in my hand. I looked down at my hand and i was holding savannah's green and black decomposed forearm. As hard as I tried to let go I couldn't. I have no clue why but I felt the need to eat it since that was the only way to get it to go away. Its texture was extremely dry and grainy like dirt. I can still feel everything i felt in that dream. I feel a terrible mix of emotions. After the first bite her arm disappeared. It took forever to swallow that huge bite I took. After it was gone I woke up in my dads old wood shed. (A shed where he stored fire wood and our lawn mower) it was a nice summer day and I looked over to see my old friend Kaiden waving to me. I realized I was somehow in his bedroom. He called his parents into the room and murdered them one at a time carving symbols into their skin. Next he came for me. I woke up and cant stop thinking about all the fucked up things I witnessed. Is there something wrong with me to think of this stuff?
