I have not been taking my dextroamphetamine for very long yet, I was prescribed it relatively recently by my psychiatrist (just under 1 month) to help me at school. but I have already had 2 instances where I take an extra dose because it feels good to draw a ton for a few hours with my burst of energy and good mood. the other morning, after having not slept that night, and not eaten yet (which probably increased the effect) I took my regular dose at the normal time, and started drawing a bunch, but i started to feel shaky, eventually having to put in extra effort to make sure my hand was moving the way I wanted it to, and even my face had tremors, and for a bit it was slightly difficult to walk. obviously i had a pounding headache from all this shit, so I wasn’t tempted to reach for it again anytime soon, but after I came down from it, I had a horrible episode of what I believe to be some level of depersonalization. It suddenly popped up while I was drawing something, like all of my purpose has instantly just dropped away. I kept drawing, thinking I had maybe over-contemplated some existential shit, and that it would just pass if i ignore it, even though it made me feel kind of numb about something I had been excited to illustrate, sort of making my process feel purely mechanical(?) Later it got to the point where I felt very surreal about my surroundings, as if I had just sort of been dropped into this world and gotten lost, which eventually transitioned into feeling as if my memories weren’t my own, and my life felt like a movie I was watching. It was kind of like I was grieving my own death, like I lost myself or left my soul behind, wanting to go back to the way I felt normal a few days ago, and terrified that this feeling would last forever. As I am writing this it is starting to wear off. I think that this type of “”withdrawal”” might mean i am addicted. I have not yet gotten a chance to talk to my psychiatrist after this experience.
