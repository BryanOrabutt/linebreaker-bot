This is me being bored and letting my head wonder. I have being thinking a lot of stuff🤔 and something came through my head. This what came through my head🤔and opinion and Let me speculate 🤔 this is just a speculation 🤔 during the WWW 1 all soldiers friendlier or enemies where using bio chemicals and gas spread like a virus. It has  the same symptoms as the corona virus. 🤔this In my opinion makes me think and wonder if we are being bio , gas in the air. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 me that i am sick and have health problems i get sick easily and i am more sensitive to whats going on the environment. For a couple of months i have being having bronchitis neumonia and breathing problems asthma etc... before the corona virus. My body has been trying to defend itself from this weird bronchitis neumonía virus. I told like a month ago to my mom that maybe it is something in the air since bronchitis neumonía is a infection u get when Air pollution , dust , and toxic gases in the environment when air is toxic. When the  news of corona virus came out i told my mom now i know whats going on with me. Remember i told i have being sick with bronchitis neumonía for months and problems with breathing. I even went to the hospital and their solution is to give me a pump. No medications they obviously they didn’t know what is going on. But know i suspect that something can be on the environment what if ? 🤷‍♀️🤔 or could be me being paranoid 🤷‍♀️or this corona virus could be what they say a virus. All this things that has being happening to me all this month it is What makes me think that this virus 🦠 can be cause by bio gas ? 🤔but i am not a professional to  get proof of it. This is just my especulación because the symptoms of the bio gas are almost the same as the corona  virus. This just my especulación. I don’t know 🤷‍♀️ i think the government should check the air and see if nothing wrong with the air. Probably i am paranoid 🤷‍♀️ but won’t hurt to check the air . Tell me what u think 🤔 probably i have to much time for myself that i am letting my head wonder 🤔but it won’t hurt to check the air environment to discard any possibility.
