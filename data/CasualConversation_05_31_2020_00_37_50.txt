So me and my brothers used to go out and explore abandoned building when we were bored and my eldest brother (callum) brought his girlfriend for the first time (this plays a part in what happened) so we were in an old tech factory and we were looking through some of the old large containers and they were filled with old xbox components and a couple of working ps2's this was maybe 10 years ago btw. So we decided to take them with us since they had just been left and we moved onto the next place, bow the next one wasnt what we would usually do it wasnt an abandoned factory, it was one of those large sites that is used to store those really large metal containers that go on cargo ships and we noticed some of them were open so of course we were young and stupid and opened them to find.....cardboard boxes lol literally nothing else just a bunch of cardboard, so we made use of them and took the whole containers worth if cardboard out of it and put it in a pile and we spent the next 20 minutes jumping from the top of the container onto the boxes (was really fun tbh) but then my oldest brothers girlfriend had a nose bleed (she always got them really bad) so there was nothing to stop the bleeding of her nose there so we wrapped up one of our t shirts and held it against her nose and when we took it away after it dried there was so much blood and a blood clot attached itself to the shirt, so we quickly put all the stuff back inside the containers including the shirt and ran home. 2 days later my mum was driving us to see my gran and we passed the container site and omg there we saw it. Two police Van's a bunch of yellow tape and 6 men inside a white tent with those full white suit things on, it was a forensic team and they had a camera set up outside the container we emptied and were slowly pulling out boxes expecting to find a body (fron all the blood they saw. Turns out the place wasnt abandoned at all and was in fact used regularly so when the owner found blood outside one of the containers he called the police. Long story short my mum had to take us to the police station to explain everything and that it was us that left the blood and that no one was murdered or anything lol they had told us they were expecting to pull out severed limbs or something. Of course they still done a full search of the place in case we were lying but they found out it was just us playing with cardboard boxes and my brothers girlfriend had a nose bleed lol and that's one of my life stories :)
