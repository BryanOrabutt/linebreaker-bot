Hey gays lol. Today I got my heartbroken. I've been speaking to this incredible guy for the past 2 months. As a matter of fact, I matched with him on Tinder two months ago yesterday. Tinder is very gross but I am very glad I downloaded it because I met him. Today he messaged me saying he does not want to be in a relationship because he does not want to open up and whatnot but I really like the guy. I told him we could be friends and see where that goes because I am willing to wait and see what happens and hope for the best. I like him a ton and he said he likes me to but right now he does not have the time. I don't want to sound like I am desperate because that's not the case at all. I simply like him and him only, and I'm certain it will stay like that for a while. He said he would be okay with being friends for the time being and I am okay with that 100% because I would prefer to have a genuine connection with someone and let it grow through time. Everyday I tell him how my day was and he does the same and I truly love telling him about my day. I have many friends but I prefer to tell him about my day over them, which is probably because I "like" him while I like my friends. Would it be weird if I continues to tell him about my day. Please keep in mind that I send lengthy descriptions and he likes them but I don't want to push any boundaries. Tomorrow, I was supposed to study with him for a class and watch a movie on Friday. Should I still ask if he's still down or simply stay quiet. I am very bad at taking signs. I am nearly certain he likes me as well but he just does not have the time and does not want to open up. Should I bring the idea of taking it very slowly to the table or...actually I'm going to bring it to the table. Hopefully, it goes well because I like him and he's very nice
