I've been ill for months, with no help. Ice had to get 3 blood tests done already because my GP is careless with her instructions. The first one was useless because I couldn't be on the pill for which I was,they they had the audacity to get mad at me for not knowing and "wasting" their time. Dude I paid you 40 bucks for this, YOU wasted MY money and I had to take time out of college so fuck right off with that shit. Second one they neglected to tell me had to be done on the first day of my period, so i arrived on day 3 because I couldnt get an appointment and they say nothing until the results come back funny, and tell me I have to do it again. That's 80 dollars gone now, and I'm getting annoyed. I get sent off for an ultrasound, and they cant decide if I have cystic ovaries or not. So they want another damn blood test. So once again I've been off the pill for another month, my hormones are a mess, I have no idea when I'll bleed and have to carry shit around everywhere, and now I have to try get another appointment, and miss more college. OH and I forgot to mention, they only do blood tests on wednesdays and mondays. So trying to schedule that is pretty fucking impossible. So I went in and asked to be referred elsewhere because this is ridiculous. They have the fucking nerve to tell me, 7 MONTHS AND 80 DOLLARS later that they actually do blood tests every day. I tell them that whenever i had attempted to make an appointment I was always told only Monday's and wednesdays, and they give me such a condescending look and tell me I must have gotten it mixed up. I know i can confuse times and dates, but theres no way I would have messed up something so expensive and important. Also appanretly now it's fine for me to get bloods done on days other that the first day of my period. WTF stupid careless people treating me like an idiot and wasting my time and money, then trying to blame me for their bad management. Fuck right off you silly cows.
