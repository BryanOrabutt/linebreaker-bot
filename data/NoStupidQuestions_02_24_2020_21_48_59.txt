This was a year ago when I decided to finally take the initiative about getting some depression meds. Went to the doctor, stopped by the pharmacy and I could have sworn that I told them to keep all accounts SEPARATE from my family who lives under the same roof. Several times after, my grandpa comes home from the freaking pharmacy with MY shit that I’m trying to keep private because they use anything and everything against me and to poke at me and tell me I’m stupid I’m an idiot I’m broken I’m incompetent I don’t know what I’m doing or talking about et cetera et cetera what have you, and this is why I fucking have depression in the first place! I made up some BS story to my family about “oh that’s a prescription from years ago” which they probably didn’t buy. To this day I’m curious if the pharmacist still asks which I wouldn’t be surprised. I had to tell them no I don’t want it and to shut up about it enough times for them to stop asking me if I want them to bring it home for me. I didn’t take much of that prescription because it made me feel horrible, but now I’m interested in trying a different one. I have an appointment soon to request a prescription for the one I want, but I WANT THE DAMN PHARMACISTS TO SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION LIKE I TOLD THEM TO!!! Ever since that happened I’ve daydreamed about cussing them out, because wtf how is that not a HIPPA violation??? What REALLY grinds my gears about it THE MOST is that the pharmacists CLEARLY see that it’s a ducking anti-depressant, but they don’t stop to think “huh, I wonder what gives a person depression? It could be a handful of things, but one of the things for a lot of people is BEING AROUND TOXIC-ASS PEOPLE, [and I don’t use that “toxic” term lightly], HMM, MAYBE, the reason she’s been refusing her medication, and the reason she told us to KEEP ALL ACCOUNTS SEPARATE is because these PEOPLE are seeing that she’s taking medication and giving her a hard time”!!! I mean by-golllly, for somebody who went to medschool to be trained to work at that place, they sure know how to throes years of an education out there window and it look out for the greater good of the people 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 and I know you’re gonna say, “go to a different pharmacy” but we live in a small town and they use all of the pharmacies within proximity depending on whichever’s most convenient at the moment I guess, I don’t really know their system, but I know that any pharmacy that is close enough for me to get to, they’re registered at also and still frequently use
