I have loved you for so long that it feels weird to even say it. I fell in love with you the moment I saw you, in 6th grade. At first it was a crush, because I was so young. But then, years went on, and I understood I loved you. We shared so much, so many memories and secrets. You knew everything about me, I knew everything about you. We had each other backs, we were there for one another. We protected each other, it was us against the world. Then I got sick. Depression is a cruel beast, and it was eating me from the inside. I pushed you away, and you pushed back and stayed close to me. You helped me, you supported me. I could see the pain in your eyes when you saw me sobbing desperately in front of you, yet I was blinded by my illness, and I thought you were like everyone else, and that you hated me. Yet you were there for me. I got out of depression, we grew older, but the damage I had done was too much, I was losing your trust, probably, you felt like I didn't like you as a person, as a friend. We were going to different high schools, we would never hang out together. Started going out with new friends. Every day I missed you more and more, and my regret was always more. There was nothing I could do to fix this. I tried, but we became strangers,slowly, painfully, as if we never were friends. Now we are strangers. We don't know anything about each other. I want to hug you, hold your hands, as I never got to experience those things with you. I want to be there for you. I want to be known by you. Yet I can't. I made too many mistakes, and now we're destined to be strangers, we're destined to look at each other, smile and look away, both aware of the pain. I wish I could read your mind to know if you feel the same, I wish I had the courage to tell you this, before you forget about me. I love you, you will always have a special place in my heart.
