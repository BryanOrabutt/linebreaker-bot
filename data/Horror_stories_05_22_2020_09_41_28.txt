This story has multiple parts to it. So I get outta bed at night cause Im hungry, like you do. And Im in the living room about to turn to the kitchen when I hear a little girls voice say "Help" so I rush over to where my pitbull mix is asleep and I cuddle up to her with my heart racing. Keep in mind, I am not a small dude, but I am terrified. So I call my mom and she says just stay there till she gets home. Then I went back to bed. A few months later Im walking into my garage and I here the same voice say "Hi" and I thought it was one of my sisters, but they weren't home. So I walk back in and tell somebody. So I go back to what I was doing and I look in the glass of the window on the door of the garage and theres the sweet face of a little girl. But then it begins to distort and laugh a deep, demonic laughter that scares me to my core. So I run back and say a prayer and grab my dog, and I go back out and theres nothing. Then about 1 year ago I kept hearing noises in my house. Mostly above my room. Which is below the attic. So I went to go check it out. Much to my surprise nobody was up there. So I went downstairs and I was walking out of the hall when a massive boom happened. I was 15 but I almost had a heart attack, so I pressed my big, muscular frame against the wall as I tried to calm myself. I was in shock so I couldn't do anything but calm down. I went to check if I was alone in the house, and of course I was. So I decided to do what I thought I could. I made holy water and anointing oil. As I made them, the lights in my house flickered. I felt happy. So I blessed some objects and went to cleanse the house. I did that and then all has been well for this long. If there are any updates, I will let you know
