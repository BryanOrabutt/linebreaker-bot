Hi guys!  This is my first post here.  I need some help.   My sister took my boys in last year because I needed to go to rehab for alcoholism and my addiction to weed.  She took guardianship of them in December with our blessing.  My husband is a long haul truck driver and I am technically homeless as I am in a halfway house.  I am working full time and going to school full time to become a medical assistant.  I am all for what she is doing for my boys.  She’s getting them the best education and medical care for free in MA.  I am in Florida.  We have no problem paying for their basic needs but she keeps signing them up for really expensive things that I think could be done cheaper and is now asking for another $27,000 on top of the $473.00 per week that we pay, for back expenses.  I blew up and my entire family will not speak to me.  There are free camps and things that she could sign them up for rather than ones that cost several thousand dollars.  They don’t want me involved due to my recovery but I get dragged in anyway.  So, I know squat about what’s happening except when people are upset and vent to me.  Now she has cut off visitation until they can get into therapy.  Mind you, I saw them at Christmas which I had to fight for.   I won’t get to see them again until next Christmas due to my school and work schedules. It’s my husband.  He has not seen them since Christmas and asked for 1 day in March to see them.  It was after I asked what day he could see them that she cut us off.  I feel like she’s trying to build a case to take them permanently and bleed us dry because she can’t have kids and has grand plans for her house that she can’t afford.  I can’t take much more of this.  What can we legally do to ensure my husband gets adequate time with them and stop her free spending of our money so she stops coming back asking for more?  Any advice would be welcome.  Thank you for listening to my plight.
