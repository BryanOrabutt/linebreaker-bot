On Easter last year, my boyfriend had his friends over and eventually, all except one left. His friend eventually started pulling on my leg and telling us he was open to anything because he felt that was the vibe we were giving. Since they were drunk, I did not want to overreact and explained that there is definitely no vibe. My boyfriend laughed it off but this went on for 2 hours, us explaining there was no vibe. He ended up pulling his d**k out twice and when I went in the bedroom, I was naked under the covers, he came after me. That was when I screamed and my bf kicked him out. 
The next morning, his friend did not remember anything and my bf broke up with me because he felt I had something going on with the other guy since he did that. It was the first time he just told me to leave without talking to me or giving an explanation when we had a fight or broke up. I started packing and he realized he was wrong, so he did a 180 and hid the key so I would not leave because he overreacted. We ended up being together but I eventually broke up with him, mostly because of his reaction and also because of other problems we had. He wants us to get back together and we both still have feelings for each other, but I keep remembering the incident and crying when I see him. I might want to still be with him but I just want to forget everything. I get violent and overreact when a man makes a comment about my appearance or touches me in any way. I know I overreact and I just want to get that out of my head. I also hate that it ruined my relationship. I don't want to be this way, but I do not know what to think anymore. Before it happened, we woke up smiling next to each other and after, I would tell him not to touch me and I would wake up crying. I do this to all men that get too close now. Help? Should we get back together because it is not worth it to break up over an idiot? Should I run as far away as I can? Hoe can I not let this affect my reaction to other men?
