So recently I (17M) have gotten back together with my ex gf(17F). We have been together for about a month now and we used to date when we were 14. We broke up because we were too young and the relationship was getting too intense for us and we were having problems and bickering a lot. A little bit after we broke up one of my friends at the time told me that he had been texting my gf while we were dating and she had been sending nudes and flirting with him all the time. Now ik a lot of you might be thinking I'm crazy for taking her back but she had reasons for cheating on me which in no way excuse why she did it. Apparently she thought I was cheating on her because one of my psycho ex friends had told her that she was getting together with me. And this was how she reacted to that, she has admitted that what she did was a terrible thing and shes felt awful about it ever since she did it. What's even worse is that I was completely faithful to her throughout that relationship. Needless to say it fucked with how I was with girls after. It's very hard to get my trust and I get scared off easily. Now back to the present day me and her are dating and its going very well I've forgiven her for the past as we were stupid kids and I wasnt the best bf myself. I'm very much in love with her again and she is with me. However sometimes I get anxiety about being cheated on again. I trust her but I cant help but worry about all the guys she hangs out with who have all asked her out and have/have had crushes on her. I'm someone who worries about a lot of things I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety for a very long time and due to things in my childhood it makes it even harder to trust people even if she hadn't cheated on me. I just wanna know how to deal with the anxiety and get used to her hanging out with all her guy friends. So far I haven't said anything to her and idt I will as I dont want to come off as a jealous bf. Any and all advice is appreciated.
