First off I been on reddit for years just never made an account but I felt like I should now but about a year ago (15 then) I ran into a friend I knew from a school I used to go to at the park and he seemed really cool and we were talking and he gave me his Snapchat to lmk when he would be up at the park so we could play basketball and stuff and that night we were texting and joking and he asked my if I wanted to get pyo with this girl he knew and I was dumb and said sure and she asked for nudes and I sent them (yes ik how stupid that is now and won’t do it again trust me) she screenshot them and basically blackmailed me for 2-3 months by threatening to take me to the police (I wasn’t sure what would happen or what the laws were I just didn’t want to be marked as sex offender or something for child pornography and I was scared of my family finding out long story) she also blackmailed my friend and she forced me and him to have sex multiple times for 2-3 months and mind u I’m straight and don’t like men I just didn’t want to get into trouble with the law and eventually she said we would have to have sex one last time and after we did they both left me alone for a few months and then suddenly came back a few months later and apparently still had my pictures and started blackmailing me again and me and the guy had sex 1 or 2 more times and then eventually I had enough and told them to just call the police because iI couldn’t do it anymore and I would’ve rathered to kill myself then keep getting blackmailed so I figured a record was better than dying and they never did it and they recently texted me but I blocked them and ignored them and nothing has happened since but it’s always on my mind and I had to get it off my chest even tho I block it out of my mind as best I can I still feel like I can’t go back to my park cuz I don’t want to see him there
