 A year ago, i has under ocd attack and anxiety. ocd suggested me      ocd: make a promise to God not to return to your house in order to get other napkins. Make sure you are going to validate and make sure to make it with your own will. this promise will help you stop do the ocd ritual. validate it by making the cross sign 3 times.        This suggestion of my ocd would help me out of the ocd ritual by forcing myself out by making a promise to God.   I think i never validated by doing the cross sign 3 times because I stopped at 2 and said that I am not making a promise. i am not sure if promise is valid or not. some words popped like "never return home to get other napkins"         Today, I left my other house in my hometown with my brother. i was having some A4 papers for something that needed to be done. I put the a4 in my brother's car but brother told me we were going using the other car and I had already put the A4 in it. my brother came with me to the first car that i put a4, unlocked it and took the a4 and gave them to me.  I started freaking because   ocd was like    ocd: you made a promise to God a year ago, not to return to your house to get napkins. right now, you just returned to the car with your brother to get the a4 papers you put inside. you did not take them but brother opened the door, took them and gave them to you. that counts as if you were the one who returned to the car to get the A4. and that counts as if you returned to your house to get napkins because the car was in the parking of the house and the A4 are not napkins but are made of paper. your action counts as if you returned home to get napkins. do you see any relation? i am worried again.
