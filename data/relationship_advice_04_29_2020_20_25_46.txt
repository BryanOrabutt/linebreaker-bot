I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for about two years and have known him for nearly 10. Before the stay at home order was placed we had talked about moving in together this summer and me staying with him at his condo for a week or so to see how things go. Right after this conversation they announced that we would be sheltering in place later that week and he asked me to stay with him. It has been almost 6 weeks now and things have gone pretty well, still no end in site for the end of this order. The other day he said he needed me to go after the order was over to make sure he wanted to move in with me, I was surprised by this because I thought we had already decided that would be the case from our conversations during the 6 weeks. I had mentioned that I was thinking about signing a lease about 6 months ago and he said he thought we were going to move in soon so I waited. Well now the lease I currently have is about to end and I have to make a decision now and he still doesn't want me to sign a lease but says it could be anywhere from 1 month to 10 years before he's ready to move in with me. I'm kind of hurt by this and blindsided, part of me thinks that I should walk away from the relationship because it seems as if he isn't considering my feelings or needs at all and the other part of me is trying to be understanding. I know this is difficult times but I am unsure what to do. I have been patient and not pushy at all but I said then I need some space from him to prepare myself emotionally to get my own place and dismantle the idea of us living together. He said that it was unnecessary for me to do that and asked me to stay. I'm not sure why he is being wishy washy and when I try to talk to him about it he shuts down. It would be a shame to walk away because we do have a loving relationship and maybe I am missing his point of view some how so I was hoping to get opinions to make an informed decision.
