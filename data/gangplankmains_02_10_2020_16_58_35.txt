Hey everybody ,as the title states i actully lost faith in climbing , my mains are singed and gp ( i always pick gp and soemtimes i feel like playing singed ), it just feels that when my botlane is ahead i will win even if im 0/10 and if my botlane was stomped ill lose even if im 12/0 , like i really dont know what to do , i know i should improve my gameplay , im improving my cs and vision but its still hard when ur adc is useless , and ur jungler doesnt care about objectives , i stoped tilting tbh , im losing games and i dont care anymore im just playing for fun and bcz i enjoy playing gp( this champion is next level fun ), i know climbing is possible but i might be just bad , i really dont know how smurfs manage to 1v9 in my elo with such an ease , im really sick of watching alot of videos to learn bcz im not really benefiting from them , i have learned a little of wave management , trading and stuff like that but its really useless when the enemy kaisa has 14 kills and can onehsot you when ur actully 5/0 against the enemy nasus and u have denied him alot of stacks and have a 40 cs lead , long story short im just playing for fun now , im playing the best i am able to be and just dont care ( i was gold 4 last season and now im hardstuck in silver 2 ).Not gonna lie there still is a part of me that wants to improve and climb because thats the only game i play and its really not fun when ur playing and playing and playing and ur still where you are !  whenever i play a game thinking like that i would hard tilt if i lose , ik toplane sucks but its not an excuse to not climb specially from silver bcz there is alot of toplane mains in high diamond and challenger and the rank 1 on euw is actully a toplaner which is Fnc Bwipo. I really dont knoe if i should just quit the game or just play from time to time because its not really fun when you feel like all your games are just a waist of time :/.
