So I’m fairly new to Lyft and I was requested to pick up a passenger from Home Depot type store.  When I arrive the rider( 40-50 year old man) Demands I get out and help him load up his building supplies.  Now I would have helped him any way but the way he asked was very disrespectful  but wanting to keep my five star streak I get out and help him.  Now this wasn’t your normal load of groceries,  it was around 14 cinderblocks , a couple buckets of cement, and a cart full of bags of nails and other building supplies etc...  After the first couple cinder blocks he goes and sits In my car and tells me to load up the rest.  Expecting a big tip in return and a good review I load it up and start driving.  The next thing he tells me is he’s surprised I can drive good  because” all the other black guys that have driven him were Terrible drivers”.     Ignoring this comment I keep driving and I hear him talking to his wife in Spanish unaware that I can understand him saying incredible racist things.   When I get to his exit it’s road blocked so I keep going and he begins to tell me how he knew “my people never know the right way to go”.    As I’m driving he tried to grab my phone out of my lap while I’m still on the highway instinctually I grab it first and ask him wtf  he thinks he’s doing.  He said he wanted to put on some music.  By this point I’m infuriated and keep my mouth clamped shut because I don’t want to snap on him.  I pull up to his house and dump his shit  as quickly as possible on his front lawn.  As I’m walking back to my car he asks me to bring all his supplies into his house,  I laugh and get into my car as I’m shutting my door he yells “ do your job nigger”.   It took me everything I had to stay in my car and drive away.
