Sorry if this is long, i haven’t been on bfs reddit in months but i had to get this off my chest. I’ve never posted on here but I was once a lurker. I never experienced anxiety before until August of 2019 when I started experiencing heart palpitations constantly. After a couple of weeks I noticed my muscles would twitch all of the time and of course I thought i had ALS. After a trip to the doctor he told me that i was hypervigilant and that it was all anxiety. After that reassurance and some battling mentally, the twitching completely stopped for almost 4 months but the anxiety didn’t. Anyways, back in late December I was smoking with a friend and I started to trip out and get really anxious and this of course brought back a twitch and ever since then it’s been back everyday. I have some days where I barley twitch at all, feel great and i can keep it out of my mind. But also I have really bad days like tonight where ever since I’ve laid down, it’s been every 5 minutes and it’s driving me nuts. I’m no longer afraid of it being anything serious and not once have I associated it with als, my biggest fear is that it will never go away and I will always be like this the rest of my life. I look at myself back just a year ago and how happy i was and it makes me hate everything about me and how I’ve even let myself become like this. I notice when I don’t think about it, it usually doesn’t happen but then I think too myself “I haven’t twitched in 1 hour I wonder when it will happen” then boom. It makes me think with the millions of people with anxiety and yet I feel like this is so rare that I’m some kind of freak. I’m really looking for some answers as too how I can put this past me for good. I’m not too sure how i did it the first time, i would just try to not even notice it and when I did; I’d just say it’s anxiety but it hasn’t been working for me latley.
