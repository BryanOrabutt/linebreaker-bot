I dated someone who had anxiety, she cheated and blamed it on hallucinations and kind of blamed it on me because we were away for a few weeks and all that bs, I gave her a chance and she just never improved, she broke my trust so many times although she did not cheat again, there were other things that she did to keep on breaking my trust. I tried to break up with her a lot of times but never was so strong. She eventually broke up with me and blamed it on her condition but I am so much better without her. Now she is trying to be petty by bringing up the guy she cheated on me with. And these kind of people are incapable of love, they are so manipulative. They will keep finding excuses for their mistakes and they will try to find faults in you and blame you for their cheating or whatever else they do. These are the worst kind of people, who are extremely ungrateful for what they have and never try to find the good in things. They blame everything on their condition but never try to work on improving it but rely on others and blame them for their mistakes. NOTICE the RED FLAGS!! NEVER forgive cheating and DO NOT let love make you blind. DO NOT get very attached to a person. I now have anxiety and trust issues thanks to her but I am improving and I am so much better. BREAK UP early because it is going to hurt later. If they cheat, even once, they have never loved you and they are NOT good for you. Especially this girl, she begged me to stay but just kept hurting me and when I tried to move on, she got very angry but then did petty things to get back at me and to hurt me. These type of people are NOT good people, please get out of this kind of a relationship if you are in one. Trust me, you will be a LOT BETTER! I am going to uni soon and I am so excited to start a new chapter of my life, learning so much and leaving all the TOXIC people behind!
