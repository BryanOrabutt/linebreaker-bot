So a few years ago there's a girl I wanted to be friend with. No hidden meaning,purely just wanted to be friend cause she seems cool but she moved away before I can befriend her.So I get to know her online instead,we have a lot of thing in common so befriending her was fun.She was very open about her own problems,she told me she had anxiety and depression which got me very worried so I tried my best to help her even though only capable being verbally since she moved out by giving advices and trying to comfort and she do the same when Im feeling down. since then we got closer and she start viewing me more like a big brother and I start seeing her like my own little sister that I never had.A few years later I start catching feelings for her,despite never been seeing her in real life.I want to be a relationship,but due to me having no knowledge in winning a girl's heart and or even flirting I seek my friends that in relationship for advices.I even give them codename "Cupid" for fun and since their advices does work.After a few months of pretty much simping over her my friend and I think it's the right time to confess and so I did.My expectation were very low actually,low expectation leads to happier outcome that's what I keep in my own mind.I even told her that its okay if she does not accept that confession and that she should not lie as it hurt 20 times more than usual rejection.But she accepted my confession,I really can't believe that I finally get a girlfriend for the first time in my life so I was incredibly ecstatic.Unfortunately that happiness didn't last as that relationship only last for 2 weeks.From her chat i can tell something going on as it feel like she stop losing interest so I ask her whats happening but she refuses to tell me anything.One day, she confronted me bout our relationship and says she wanted a breakup. I was very shocked and she tried to explain that the main reason why she accepted me was because she don't want to lose her friendship with me and saying that she's not the one for me.I tried to keep my cool,act like it's nothing major and try to brush it off.But that rejection really get to me.I was really overwhelmed by own feeling since she was giving me fake hope from the start and fake hope 20 time more stronger than usual rejection to me. So a few days later I chat with her and said "Hey uh I really just need to get this off my chest but F*ck you for not rejecting me from the start. Sorry" which she proceeds to reply with "I'm hurting as much as you are,leave me be" and start ghosting me since then.I tried to apologize many times but all were unsuccessful.AITA?Harsh comment are acceptable.
