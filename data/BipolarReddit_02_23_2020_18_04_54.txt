I have bipolar 2 disorder, substance abuse disorder and ptsd from reoccurring trauma, neglect and abuse in my formative years, i receive ssdi because I’m legally disabled, and currently live with my mother, she is also disabled and requires full time care from me, she for the last 8 years has fueled my addiction to opiates by repeatedly suggesting I take her pain medication when ever I’m dealing with back pain, I’ve gotten clean in the past and managed to stay clean for a year or more, than she waves her pain meds in front of me tempting me to take them when I’m in the slightest amount of pain, this time around I had to threaten to move out if she did it again, I’ve been sober for 7 months now and I’m becoming increasingly aware that she is emotionally abusing me, she criticizes everything I do, every single day, no matter how I’m feeling her well being is more important than mine, when I try to stand up to her, she starts crying and acts like I’m victimizing her, and makes me feel like I’m a shitty person, she’s a hoarder and we live in a single wide mobile home and it’s gotten so bad I have to sleep in the living room, because there’s no room anywhere else, I have nowhere else to go, and I can barely even see my own doctors because she is so dependent on me, every time I go to my counselor or doctors appointment she messages me repeatedly through the entire appointment asking when I’m coming back home, this morning she started being nasty to me because I don’t make her spaghetti anymore, because I don’t go to great lengths to prepare home cooked meals for her enough, when some days I can barely feed myself, whenever I’m not doing well and try to talk to her about it, she accuses me of saying she’s a bad mother and makes everything about her and that she has it so much worse than me, she’s morbidly obese and can barely walk now, I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m losing my sanity, I’ve been hypomanic for weeks and I’m no longer sleeping, I feel like I’ll never be free, and I just wanna to give up.
