my boyfriend just broke up with me yesterday after being together for 2 years, we’ve been dating since senior year of high school. he broke up with me because he felt like with everything going on with his life he couldn’t put me as his top priority anymore and that he didn’t want me to lower my standards for him. he said when hes ready to be in a relationship again that we might get back together, but he might also develop feelings for someone else but i would be the first to know about it and that hurt me so much to hear, to even think of him being with someone else. he says he still wants to be friends and he wants to keep our snapchat streak going, but other than that he doesn’t want any other communication with me until after a couple weeks have gone by. it was unexpected and it hurts sooo bad it feels like he took apart of me with him, i really thought he was the love of my life and that we were gonna get married and have kids and all that because he always said that’s what he wanted. he was my first real boyfriend, i’ve never gone through heartbreak before and i feel like im never gonna get over him. no matter what i do i can’t get my mind off him and this pain is unbearable. especially being in quarantine and having nothing really to do or go it feels like time is going by so slow. i only have 2 friends and my brother that have been helping me through it but i don’t want to bother them all the time with my problems and i’ve just been feeling really alone because i have social anxiety and i only truly felt comfortable being myself with my boyfriend and now i don’t have him anymore. i feel like i’m never going to have a connection with anybody else like i did with him. if anyone else has gone through something similar or just heartbreak in general please let me know how you got through it and how long the process of moving on took for you, because i don’t even know where to start.
