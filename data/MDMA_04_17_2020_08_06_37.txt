Okay so please dont yell at me for being dumb, i am very very well aware of how i messed up i just need some opinions/information on what I may have done to myself on accident. It started when i took 100 mg of mdma for the third time and i will not lie it was a week after taking 200 mg for the second time, i jus had gotten a 300 mg pill and wanted to finish the other half (the 100 mg half) i had a decent time but most of the magic was gone, i assume from not waiting 3 months. Anyways thats not the mistake i made, the mistake i had made was that when i came down from the 100 mg roll i wanted to trip and i had gotten dxm, now i did not know you are not suppose to take dxm and mdma close together. Had i known this i wouldve not taken dxm the night after coming down. Anyways, i took 300 mg of dxm that night and had a pretty shitty time having tremors and blurry vision and not being able to stand even after coming down off the dxm. It felt like the entire room was falling and spinning. It was hard to tell what was the dxm and what was the backlash from taking it within close proximity of mdma. Was this serotonin syndrome? I spent the whole next day in bed jus kinda retarded watching tv. I was able to get up and take a shower about an hour after waking up but stayed in bed for the rest of the day. The next day after that i still felt very shitty but did manage to go to work and after about an hour at work felt back into the swing of things. However, i still feel like my emotions are kinda fucked up and so is my thinking, and i am taking a break from pretty much everything for a long time. I know i fucked up, i jus want to know if anyone can tell me how bad i fucked up. I apologize for being dumb, i am sorry.  (I made the flair Mdma + SSRI because a lot of what i have read about serotonin syndrome talks about ssris although i do not think dxm is one) sorry if that is wrong.
