I recently got KOTOR 2 on my Windows PC. Everything was fine even though I have a pretty bad computer. 2 days after I got the game I had a save file and then today I wanted to play and things were working I was reaching the Ebon Hawk about to leave Peragus when boom suddenly it wouldn't load me into the ship. It froze. I closed KOTOR out tried again now it wouldn't let me in the save file I had so then I restarted my computer twice to no avail but then I shut it down and it finally  would let me in the save file. A auto save was gonna allow to continue the game right were I left off but when I tried to open it it closed out KOTOR and I opened KOTOR back up and went to my save file that I had saved manually knowing I would only be losing 5 minutes of progress and it let me in. I load excited to be back in but then when I'm finally in I'm a different character. I notice immediately 3 really weird things. 1 in the party menu it appears as I'm a black female with short black hair yet in the game I'm a white blonde male. 2 I'm in the place where after you called up the droid (TM-3?)  and now you're the droid except I'm a white man. 3 I have no clothes or items and I only have a lightsaber and a gun. It's literally impossible to be with a lightsaber at this point of the game since it's very close to the start. I open up a locked door and then I'm met with droids. Weird thing is I have level 3 force lightning (force storm) and I have a lot of force abilities maxed out as well as that I have my attacks at max even though in my save file I have none of this. Then I go to my menu and I have a different name. I don't get it. I have a ton of stuff I shouldn't have and I'm back to a point I had crossed even though I've saved past this and loaded in multiple times in points after it. I deleted my auto save thinking I had done it and now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna regret it. Help me reddit please.
