Hi my name is Sefa I'm a sixteen year old boy I have money issues. first I'm gonna talk about my back story. my father was an absolute jerk and always used to have a fight with my mother since I was little I always had problems at school when my sister was born he left us and my mother has been a the only support of my life later on I found my hobby anime and I never wanted stuff for myself I was just a depressed boy who wanted to stay inside and just watch anime when I was 15 my art teacher cured my depression with art then I had a dream of being an artist later on my passion for drawing got away and I began who I was when I was before later on I watched an anime called Houseki no kuni (Land of the Lustrous) It was about gemstones/crystals and was really fascinated by the show and got a new hobby collecting gemstones/crystals and had a new dream having my own crystal shop that was like 6 months ago I wanted many crystals later on I wanted more expensive gems like Opals or Ruby's my mom and my big sister thinks my passion for crystals is worthless and they also discouraged me when I turned sixteen in March I bought some of some expensive gems but didn't have much options and my aunt promised me to go buy me some crystals with her some days later she said she can't because she was scared of the the situation going on the earth and gave me 50 euro's I didn't want to buy crystals with that money because I thought it would be overkill while school had shut down I began watching more anime I came across an anime called Bakumatsu Rock well obviously it's about rock it was a pretty cool anime and I became liking the guitar and I actually wanted one I asked my mom if could buy one she said that she was going to give me 5 euro's every week I was really happy I waited for about a month and now I have enough to buy a guitar but today I realized that I also need an amp got a bit discouraged for that reason so I just watched another anime it's called Bang Dream! It's another anime that's about music the main character got a new guitar called Random Star I looked it up and it seems like it's a real guitar and has Bang Dream! signiture version but the price is way too much for me I got in depression again I knew I can't get signiture version and if I don't soon enough it will be gone now I feel like I want to do anything to earn money fast even offering my body I just wanted to get this out of my chest
