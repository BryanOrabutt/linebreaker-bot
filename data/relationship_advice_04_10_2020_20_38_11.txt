my boyfriend tends to get viciously mad when he gets mad. I tend to deal with them but yesterday i was not going to have it, and it was a catastrophe, bags were packed, hurtful words were said and where windows where broken. i admit i did break his window for locking me out after he was trying to kick me out and taking off with my car. an hour or two later we settled down inside after his mom got us to stop acting crazy. we sat apart from each other and he started smoking. then he handed me the blunt and sat next to me as an apology. he tends to black out when he's mad an not think about his actions. he apologized and we moved on. Today, he made alot of jokes saying "we should just be friends with benefits" and then when i would get mad hed reply with "i was joking". also kept calling me best friend and sister, knowing it made me mad. i finally decided to ask him to sit down and have a conversation about our relationship and talk out our dislikes and etc. it led to him saying he thought we were better off as friends. he said i was too clingy, imature and childish, and he didn't think we were working out. i expressed that i cant be friends with my exs etc and he acknowledged it. he had to drop off a money order at a car place a good 1hr away and as he was walking out the door he asked,"are you still gonna be here when i get back?" . i replied with "do you want me to be here when you get back?". "i wouldn't mind it," he said. he said he was going to take a good 3 hours ish and left. i dont understand. what should i even do i just love this man to death i know it's not healthy but i rather stick around than deal with the pain i can't take another heart break. is the problem really me ? do i need to find hobbies to stop being clingy and learn how to stop being so childish ? is it the quartines fault ?  there is nothing at all to do, we WERE fine before the lockdown. any comments or advice help.
