So about a year ago, I started dating this girl and felt like we really had a good connection (This was Junior year in high school). She was beautiful and funny, and I was, well funny (I only consider myself a bit better than average looking, idk may be because of low self esteem).  One day she tells me that she feels that she likes me more than I like her; which was false, but I understood where she was coming from because I have a slightly monotone voice and not very expressive, and I wasn’t taking my OCD medication which made me slightly more anxious than normal, so I didn’t go out of my way to make plans, she made them all. Nor did I tell her that I had OCD, which looking back I definitely should have (I wasn’t think straight at the time, and felt that if I told her, she wouldn’t think I was normal). Anyways a bit of time past, and I got food poisoning on Valentine’s Day and I was out of school for an entire week. I texted her while I was out, but because I had food poisoning I didn’t feel like texting her often. Then on February 19, our last conversation occurred; her final text was “I gtg, I hope you get better, love you 💕”. I texted her 2 or 3 days later and didn’t get a response, then I tried again ,and nothing. I didn’t want to believe that I got ghosted at first, until I returned to school and she wouldn’t walk nor talk with me. A month later or so she got a boyfriend, but broke up with him fairly quickly. Ever since then, anytime I see her in the hall, and look at her she’s always looking back at me, then quickly looks away when our eyes lock. I haven’t talked to her, but It seems like she feels bad about the whole thing, and her mood visibly changes when I’m in her view. I’ve only had one relationship since her that also didn’t last too long, and I’ve seen her more than usual this week, and she looks at me way more often too. I’ve been thinking of her a lot recently and I want to talk to her to figure out what happened (or maybe hook-up). I feel like she’s too embarrassed to text me, but I don’t want to text her first because she was the one who ghosted me, and I’m not too sure who’s fault it is.
