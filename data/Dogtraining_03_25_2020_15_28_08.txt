So we've got a 4 month old german shepard mix and we've had her for about three weeks now. We originally started her on pee pads because she was unvaccinated and the weather  (its been raining and snowing) made it impossible to go outside to train her to. Since then she's only had one set of shots. As of right now, has a pee pad spot with a play pen to kind of fence off and then her crate is next to it. She doesn't like her crate very much so we didn't train her to be in it but she sleeps next to our bed every night and goes potty  (#1 and #2) in her play pen pee pad area. This whole shelter in place has kinda given us an advantage to spend alot of time with her and she has very few accidents and knows when to go. Now that she's got the hang of her pee pads, we want to transition her to going outside especially now that it isn't raining as much, and she has at least one of her shots. She has gone to the bathroom outside before when i would watch her like a hawk and catch her before she does her business but this was before she got the hang of her pee pads. Now everytime we think she needs to go to the bathroom (and you can tell bc she'll go to her pee pad spot and sniff around) we take her outside but she doesn't want to go. Once we went to a relatives house over the weekend and we took her out several times and she never went and we were there for about 5 hours that day but as soon as we got home she went to the bathroom right on her pee pad spot. How can I motivate her to go to the bathroom outside more? I've read suggestions from other posts like taking away her pee pads entirely and going cold turkey or moving her pee pads to the door. I am kind of curious about bell training, bc I think it would be a good idea to get some other signal, especially since now i'm working from home but I can't watch her every minute and shes a very smart puppy. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
