I feel like all the healers in the scope of the whole game are balanced, but zen isn't that balanced as a healer. I feel like all the other healers are balanced fairly as healers (even brig) and have an even balance of utility or healing. Lucio has speed and decent healing, mercy has dmg boost and great single target healing, moira has decent priority dmg and great burst heals, ana has great utility in switching between stopping enemy heals or increasing team heals, but and zens utility in discord is really good but his heals arent great. I feel like every healer has something to do besides heals, but they can still primarily focus on heals without being useless, and zen isnt useless but if he focused on heals he isnt that great.  His dmg and dmg utility is great, but i feel he is a very underwhelming healer and that he should do more as a healer. I think itd be cool if like how discord increases dmg taken by 30% (i believe) he should also do percent healing. Sigma does percent based dmg in regards into his ult,  so I think it is more than kosher to have a percent based heals. i would think 15% of max heals per sec would be interesting enough, though the time could be more or less; but this would make heals for squishies not as optimal since 150 HP targets would only get 23 heals per second, but tanks (ex rein with 500HP ) would get 75 hp per second.  i would think that natural armor could heal slower at 10% but wtvr the value is percent based heals would be less to be not so crazy. That and/or hitting (only for zen) enemies with discord on them gives a small 1-5% (or a hp number) boost in harmony orb healing for a very short time. I dont think the boost should be very long since he fires so fast and shouldnt stack. My ideas arent the end all be all, i think your guys's ideas could be implemented way better, but I just feel zen isnt as good as a healer as others. His ult is fine though, that doesnt need to be changed.
