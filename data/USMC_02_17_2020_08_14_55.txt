So Im from Puerto Rico shipped out to Paris Island in 2017 so I get there everything is going well for the first 6 weeks DI’s don’t fuck with me that much because I used to have a heavy accent and they didn’t understand what the fuck I was saying so they anyway I’m 6 weeks it was a Sunday and the senior DI tells me to go in his office with him I go in I’m standing there at attention and just tells me “Recruit Canales you are going home there was hurricane and Puerto Rico is underwater your whole island sank everyone you know is probably dead” and I just stand there like wtf I thought he was fucking with me then he tells me to pack my shit up and leave the lock on my rifle unlocked they take me over the sign some paperwork I talk to a Lieutenant General he tells me they will try to get me home as soon as possible “as soon as the island is not a declared disaster zone” because there where no flights so they just put me in RSP and told me to wait I tried talking to some of the DI’s of RSP but they just told me to fuck off the weeks go by and I finally get a update they tell me the power in the island is not expected to go back for a year so I might SPEND A WHOLE FUCKING YEAR STUCK IN PARRIS ISLAND DOING “AREA BEAUTIFICATION” WITH THESE OTHER RSP FUCKS” and you gotta understand the recruits in RSP are bitches since I was the longest one that stayed there (they usually went home after a week) I had to explain to each new fuck how RSP worked some people had seizures others tried to kill their selfs and I had to tackle them and call the DI there was a guy that went to peoples racks at night and started jacking off while they slept it was a shit show and I had to deal with shit like that everyday anyway months go back I basically gave up at this point but at least I got a few perks I could walk around the base in my cammies, one of my DI’s let me play ps4 with him in the office and even got to go on YouTube sometimes then out of nowhere they tell me I’m going home they send me downstairs I sign my dd-214 waited till 3 am they take me to the airport and that’s it I went home I was thinking about re-enlisting so that’s why I’m on this reddit but after reading how it is when you are actually in plus what I went through fuck that.
