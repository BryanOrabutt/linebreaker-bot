I was thinking about myself and how I literally came up with this username for my reddit account years ago lol. I was in this phase where I was so obsessed with being perfect that I'd critique someone every single time they said something that was very technically incorrect, thinking I'd look smart or whatever, even if someone could just "get" what they're saying, thinking that that's what would make them not make the mistake again, when in reality I just came off as an oppressive, dominating, arrogant asshole. Unfortunately my girlfriend had to live through this phase and she's not one who really talks back since she's always had difficulty expressing herself so she just took it _every single time_ so I had _validation_ for my critiquing and my obsession with being technically logically correct over and over which made me even more sure of myself, and since I was SOOO confident and oppressive, nobody would stand up to me, but I was missing the fucking point so unbelievably hard. If you want people to follow you, then lead by example and be attractive to people in your charisma and shit, don't fucking critique the shit out of them, jesus I was so god damn obnoxious.  When someone's telling a funny story and they refer to the wrong brand of water, or something, there's no point to fucking correct it and I literally had this urge inside me that WOULD NOT let up until I corrected them. Like it was building up inside and going to explode if I didn't do it. This came about in a disillusioned phase of what a friend really was since I was lonely so I began theorizing what would be the most perfect friend and in reality I just corrected them in the ways that I thought were valid to me _only_, not even realizing that I was trying to create a world for myself separate from everyone else to be unique and secure with the idea that anyone who joined me would solidify our friendship! Guess what happens by the end of it though, I had no friends and no girlfriend because I lost them all from being an oppressive fucking asshole. I just wanted to know what this type of phase is called, this super unrealistic idealism phase that young confident people tend to go through once they meet the world for the first time and can't accept it.
