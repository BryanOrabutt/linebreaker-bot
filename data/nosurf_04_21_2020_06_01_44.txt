I’m so fucking sick of interacting with teenagers crippled with depression and anxiety. They do not know how to interact with people at all. They overshare, can’t hold a conversation or eye contact, and the vibe I get from all of them is that they’re unbelievably lonely. I swear if you actually listen to a teenager and ask them about their life they get so overly excited because normally with their “friends” they’re just talking over each other and no one actually listens to them. I consider myself to be a pretty good listener and high in empathy so I do stand out a bit BUT it still annoys me and regularly surprises me that after having two conversations with people my age they think I’m their best friend because I’m the only person who actually took interest in their lives and listened to them. Social media is conditioning people into being narcissists and kids have social anxiety because not only do you get to curate your responses on images on your phone, but you also get to  be the worst version of yourself whenever you want. In the past if someone annoyed you, I feel like you would sit with it and try to understand their side and get on with it accepting them for their flaws. Now, we’re all impatient and miserable so we just fake friendly and then go find someone or a community to talk shit to online. It’s bringing out the worst in us. Kids juul and blaze like crazy just to cope with their fucking anxieties that come from a complete lack of self-awareness and the crippling social media addiction that steals the spark from their eyes. I’m honestly ashamed to look around me at my generation. Numb except for depression and anxiety, jaded, narcissistic, shallow, insecure, brainwashed and ignorant, yet simultaneously the most opinionated. Social media is keeping us in the mind-states we had when we first got the shit which for a lot of us was our douchey, self-centered and self-conscious teen years and I really believe that in this way it is keeping us immature. And if you can’t talk to your friends about the bad parts of your day then I really feel like that means they aren’t your friends. Am I being too harsh? Toxic masculinity + social media has rendered tons of people essentially friendless in my view. And it’s all a vicious cycle because in keeping you occupied with shallow shit all day social media keeps your self-awareness away to the point where people actually think it’s deep when some internet persona comes out and says that they secretly aren’t as happy as they seem on social media like 🤯🤯🤯 if you think that’s deep then you have no fucking friends. Like if you truly know your friends you will know that social media is all bullshit. I don’t know man. I’m sorry to put out angry energy put I figured this isn’t the worst place to put this cuz some of you might just relate and therefore appreciate my rant. Anyone else have these thoughts?
