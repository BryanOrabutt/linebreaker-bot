During her senior year of high school, she started to hook up with a lot of boys, all of whom she slept with the first time they met up (she’d never met any of them before this). She even drove to a hotel to hookup with a boy she had been texting who happened to be in town (she had never met him before this either). College started off the same for her as well. She took an Uber from her dorm, which the guy made her pay for herself, to sleep with him (he was around our campus because he was playing our university in basketball). She had several one night stands where guys would invite her to go back with them from bars when she was completely sober. On top of this, she told me a boy literally sent her a text saying “come over and suck my dick” and she willingly went. Mind you, she had texted this same boy a week or two before asking to hangout and he simply ignored her text. We’ve been dating for a little while now, and I really do not have a problem with the number of guys she’s slept with. It more has to do more with the how and the where aspect of it. She also used to try and flex the guys she slept with before we dated. Mentioning that she had slept with basketball and football players out of complete nowhere. When we started hanging out, she wouldn’t allow me to kiss her or anything close to that. It’s hard to know that she was the way she was with other guys, but played so hard to get with me. But the biggest overall problem I’m dealing with is the fact that, while I was not completely innocent before we dated, I was so much more cautious and conservative with what I did with other people and who I did it with. It’s difficult for me to handle the fact that she didn’t share the same values as me before we dated. I’m considering breaking up with her now just because of how difficult the thoughts of all that stuff is to deal with and the fact that we argue about it so much. Any advice on what to do would be much aprreciated!
