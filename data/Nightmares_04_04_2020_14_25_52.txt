Last night I had a dream, a dream about being back in school (highschool) and that we were on a trip. The trip was that we went camping out in the woods and we slept in these cabins and were learning about the area. We took pictures of ourselves and the woods. Then the next day the kid with a bright red hat that had a deer on it went to go grab something, he came back with a rifle and started to shoot at us. His aim sucked at first and we were able to get away but then his shots started hitting and killing people. I heard screams of “NOOOOO!” And screams in general. Then they would die. I was the last one to be shot at and I was running around at super speed because his shots would whiz past me. Then I saw darkness and the dream started again. This time there were more classmates on the trip and I knew then what would happen. So when the kid in the red hat went to go grab something I yelled, “RUN! HES GRABBING A GUN!” People started to run every which way and soon I heard shots firing and screams that were worse and more horrifying than last time. I called police on my phone and they came within seconds and were trying to everything they could to help. I heard more people getting shot dead and I was once again running around with super speed and I found a hiding spot within a pile of rocks that wasn’t there last time. The hiding spot had a door on it like a trapdoor and I saw my friend near it so I grabbed him. We both went into the door and closed ourselves in. I brought out my phone and opened an app that’s can listen to nearby police radios and I was listening in on the shooter outside. The radio said “approximately 17 dead....no heads...shooter still shooting.....we can’t find him...there he is!...” then the radio and dream cuts to darkness and I wake up. There was about 6 people the first dream and 20 people on the next dream. And while the dream was blackness I could still hear screaming.
