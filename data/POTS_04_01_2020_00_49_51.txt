After a long battle of health issues I’ve been diagnosed with mild LVH (via EKG) doctor tells me echo will be more accurate at figuring that out and we will go from there. However I’ve struggled with palpitations since I was 17, I’ve had an electrophysiology study, ekgs echo in 2017, stress test. Thankfully all normal until the one that showed LVH. However I’ve always had this issue where if I’m sitting for a while or laying down and I go to get up I feel super faint, dizzy, and my heart races so fast and palpitates. Last week I fainted getting off the toilet and hit my head on the corner of the towel rack and hurt my head.. then a few days ago getting out of bed I almost fainted but was able to catch myself and go back onto the bed. Then last night getting off toilet again I felt funny and got to the kitchen and my heart began racing like crazy with palpitations. I’ve mentioned it before to her but I had a lot of other health issues going on so it didn’t really get to top priority. I have problems running errands, standing to do dishes, lifting my arms to do my hair. I get so jittery, sweaty, racing heart, faint dizzy and palpitations and sometimes I get very nauseous. My finger nails and toe nails turn bluish purple when cold (this is new), I sometimes get chest pain and I have mild pitting edema on my shins only. Front of the legs. If I press for 5seconds it will pit 15 seconds ish. I now have compression stockings I got at the drug store to get me by until I can be properly fitted for a pair when the pandemic is over. The current ones are 15-17mm I believe (don’t quote me) and I’m prescribed 20-30mm for when I can get those. I’m nervous but also relieved to finally have someone listen to me. It’s a hard way to live and it does make me super anxious and depressed because I can’t do normal things a lot. Having to sit to do dishes is embarrassing, and not being able to go shopping with friends or exercise because my heart goes wild.
