I met a girl 2 1/2 years ago. Fell DEEPLY in love with her.  We are both the same age (48 now), loved our time together. Spent a lot of time together. A year ago I asked her to marry me. She tearfully said yes. Furst woman I ever asked to marry me. I started seeing red flags. I wasn't meeting anyone on her side of life. She said her sisters and her had a falling out and I would probably never meet them. She always said I'd meet her Mom but I never did. I asked her after a few months why I wasn't ever asked to visit her at her place. She said she was in a shelter with her kids and a family offered to let her and her kids stay there. Later, her kids let slip that her ex husband was working on the house. She took me aside and said she was renting a house from her ex. She was a master at lying. She said there was nothing between them. That he lived in another town. Later she admitted she was living with him, but it was l ike he was a room mate. I believed her as even her kids confirmed this. 2 weeks ago she sat me down and told me she was seoerated, but still married. It devastated me. Not only that, I found out a vacation she took to Colorado with her mother and kids was actually with him. And she had me watch her dog while they were gone. My mother died in November and I took CNA classes and became a CNA. when she told me this I said fuck it all. I didn't go ij not and lost my job, I had three years of sobriety and drank again. I am at a very low point. If she would have told me she was  married but separated early on, we could have worked through it. I km now while ssd's he was married, they were separated for 8 years. She said she didn't tell me because she didn't want to lose me. But instead she routinely lied about it. I am completely lost right now. I made the decision to end it with her, but it doesn't make me feel any better.
