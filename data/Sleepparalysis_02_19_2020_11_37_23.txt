Ok, so one night I was laying in my bed watching tv and I remember I fell asleep and I woke up but not really I couldn’t determine if I was asleep or awake. I was sacred it was almost like I was just stuck pinned to my bed not able to move AT ALL it was like someone took their hands and was holding my arms down to my bed and everything els on my body, the only thing I could really move was my eyes. But I couldn’t see anyone, I couldn’t breath it was terrifying and it got worse every second. Then I look over and see a white outlined figure leaning against my dresser then it slowly makes its way to my door and then it was gone that’s when I could finally get up, I was sobscared I threw my blanket off me as fast as I could and something hit my wall I though it was my remote or my phone as I look to my dresser my phone was sitting on it and my remote was under me I didn’t know what hit the wall it sounded too large to be a remote or phone so then I went to grab my phone to see what time it was. As I go to grab my stuff I freeze I can’t move again and it scared me, then out of no where all my perfumes that were on my dresser flew off my dresser like someone slid their hand across it very angrily. I was shocked as i ran out my room my brother was coming to my room to see what was going on cause he heard the noises of the bottles and the thing hitting my wall asking if o was ok i told him idk and started to explain what just had happened. I was so shocked I couldn’t get my story strait so I ran quickly down to my mom and slept with her the rest of then night and that morning I woke up and I had been bruised on my arms and a thin but long cut on my arm that I can assure was not there the night before. I can tell you this story is 100% tru and still terrifies me to this day.
