I have had an off and on relationship ever since we were 19.  We met in college, broke up after 3 years, but still remained in contact, hooking up, going on dates, etc until now age 26.  Any way the last 2 years of our relationship were awful.  We moved to a city together and thought it would be greet. it was awful.  She is sweet, kind, wouldn't hurt a fly, etc.  I was in a very bad spot at the moment due to having no friends, a job i hated, a city i hated, and was starting to get fat/lose hair due to the stress.  Instead of using her support to help me, I was nothing but an asshole for the 2 years we lived in the city.  I was mean, rude, made her insecure, treated her like trash, started fights just to fight, all of this was due to not keeping my mentals in order, and overall just being a miserable fuck.  She did not want to leave the city but I had to get out, if I wanted to be sane, so I got a new job, said our goodbyes and left, while she stayed behind.  Shortly after she told me she would be moving an hour away from my town in the next 6 months.  Since being in a new town i like with a new job i like. My head has never felt clearer.  I am in shape, have hair, a great job, friends, etc. I am overall happy!  One of my biggest regrets is knowing how I treated this girl.  She is hands down amazing, and I feel awful.  I want to make this girl my everything.  Since I moved I have told her these things, and have been getting along great, and planning things to do.  Well she moved back yesterday, and hit me with a gut shot.  I asked her schedule and that I'd like to help her move in.  She told me she couldn't let go of what happened in the city and she wants nothing to  do with me.  What can I do?  I love this girl, and want to show her I can treat her great and be the old me.  The city thing was just a phase, and I do feel awfully.  How can I show her this if she wont even give me a chance???
