I dont know I woke up about 20 minutes ago so a lot of it has faded but i was being followed around by a woman who was offering me anything i wanted. We were locked in this large hotellish jailish complex surrounded by soldiers. ( Marines wielding rifles on their back, i noticed this because i slipped behind one and he turned and wouldnt remove his gaze from me no matter what or let me get near his gun ) There was a strong criminal population there and the implication was that I would get my ass beat if I didnt follow orders i guess. In the bottom there was a man with no legs and maybe down syndrome who i was supposed to go ask if I wanted help; but when i went there he just screamed at me and another woman that was down there ( also disabled ) asked me to leave. I noticed as I was leaving another woman was up next to ask him for something and there was a long queue of people waiting to do the same. That was a bust so I tried with the criminals and they wanted me to smuggle drugs for them but I wasnt gonna beable to do that either, so I asked the cop military dudes but they were silent. The woman offered me two other women who we could do anything with. we went to a pool and it was implied there would be an orgy between us but then even more people came to join in so I said I wouldnt because I didnt want an std. i went with the original girl who was like the "warden" and told her i didnt want these things and to take them away. she was angry with me and screaming and limited where I was able to go. I told her I didnt belong here and i didnt want to be here and i wouldnt stay. I had a seizure it felt like. Intense incredible shaking and flashing lights. I fell down a elevator shaft of sorts for like 30 seconds and i honestly can tell you i thought i died in real life and was going to somewhere. i woke up and started screaming and trying to write down or record as much of this as i could remember
