I’m not sure how I should feel about this I’ve been sober for four months I had a mess up this weekend cocaine and alcohol when I got to the house and my wife realize what had happened she manifested violently to the point of taking the next kitchen knife and threatening to stab me I would never hurt her physically and never have I needed to get a few things out of the house so that I could leave but she had me cornered with a knife calling me a pussy for not walking past her she took a couple swings with a knife I managed to dodge them I’ve struggled with addiction for a lot of years and there’s certain things that help me get back on the wagon and other things that push me right to the dealer she got me so worked up with the whole nice situation I got out of there as quick as I could to buy moreI was trying to get rid of all of the nerves that rolls up inside me from the knife experience I am not a person to make excuses or blame others for my mistakes I know I was wrong by drinking and then getting paid I am not a person to make excuses or blame others for my mistakes I know I was wrong by drinking and then getting high. But I feel like these messages could be over much sooner and I could get on the path sooner if she could react differently I feel a little bit traumatized from the nice experience she says that if I’m gonna mess up she doesn’t want to be within me anymore I told her that I’ve tried for 20 years to quit I’ve made a lot of long periods of time completely sober but I treated her like a queen but one mess up she throws it all in the trash I’m not really sure what to do right now I feel like throwing it all away and just seeing ho I feel a little bit traumatized from the nice experience she says that if I’m gonna mess up she doesn’t want to be within me anymore I told her that I’ve tried for 20 years to quit I’ve made a lot of long periods of time completely sober but I treated her like a queen but one mess up she throws it all in the trash I’m not really sure what to do right now I feel like throwing it all away Maybe some of you may reddit people I was out walking around all messed up and my in-laws her parents happen to find me I’m at their house now but honestly I feel like giving up I have been believing in God but I feel like giving that up to this Jackson Browne NPR concert. Is keeping me connected to the ground I just hope that any buddy else that is going through this is OK and that you’re not alone I don’t know what to do next I live in Chile my wife is chilean She wants me to be perfect but honesty I’ve tried my hardest and I’ve made long periods of time sober but there’s always been a relapse I can’t look in their eyes and say it’ll never happen again but she sticks around so I don’t know
