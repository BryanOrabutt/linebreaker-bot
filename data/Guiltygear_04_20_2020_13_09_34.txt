Im gonna break this down from my perspective, as a guilty gear noob. I have played rev 2 for a pretty good amount of time. (Id say near 50-60 hours) and i have pretty much 0 idea of what im doing. The game is wayyyyy too complicated to me, and in many ways, i think alot of its overcomplication is pointless, and really shouldnt be there. In my personal experience, tekken was easier for me and i can get somewhat far into the ranks. But in rev 2, i struggle to win a single round, yet i still loved the game. So then, the strive beta came around. INSTANTLY the game clicked with me. Neutral felt wayyyy better to me, and way more natural. Then within minutes, i found a combo that was longer then anything ive ever pulled off in rev 2 (11 hits, yes its sad) and it felt amazing. The combos in general felt so much better and looked so much cooler than anything ive seen in rev 2, and even did a decent amount of damage, if they were small 2-3 hit combos. And that inspired me to play more characters than sol. So i tried may, and pulled off her one button loop. Yes its a dumb combo but its so fun and satisfying to do. Then i even went to play chipp (beta ended before i could pull off the wall run combo. Those beta time slots are a horrible idea btw) and i just had a blast the whole time. Then yesterday i played rev 2 for 6 hours. It was fun, but i just couldnt do anything, nothing clicked. So, whats the problem with strive? (gameplay wise) i see people claiming its harder for new players, but atleast for me, that clearly wasnt the case. I'll list my problems with strive, but i want to know what you guys think, and why rev 2 is already considered better. My only problems with strive are; The lobby system (please erase it and never do it again) The matches being too short (i think the damage is fine, but i think matches should be 3 rounds instead of 2) some of the ui is pretty meh, and wall breaks really dont give you enough of a reward.
