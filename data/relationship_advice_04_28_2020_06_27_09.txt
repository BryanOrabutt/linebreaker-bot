Hi , I have so many things I need advice on and decided to come on here .. Me & my boyfriend have been dating for 3 years now .. I recently moved in with him (5 months ago) .. throughly our relationships I have had many trust issues not just because I want to but because I have seen his phone & have witness many flirty text messages as well as in person .. when we were in highschool , I would always see him doing something sketchy :/ .. but I stayed because he means everything to me & I care & love him (which I know is dumb but idk that’s me) .. anyways , recently I haven’t been feeling myself .. I’ve been missing my mom (me & my mom are super close) I have missed being with friends .. going out late just to go eat with my friends & I just miss being around my mom and my family .. that also lead to me changing .. my boyfriend and I will argue for EVERYTHING .. & I honestly feel like we are verbally abusive with each other which I don’t think is good :/ .. now this is another thing , when we were around 2 years we decided to deactivate Instagram bc I would always get messages of random girls telling me things about him .. so we cut off Instagram but recently we decided to get our own instagram back & that’s when a good friend of mine that tried dating me but understood that I chose my boyfriend  added my Instagram & well we ended up talking and catching up on many things .. he pretty much put interest in things that I love that my boyfriend doesn’t put interest on :/ & well I feel like I now feel some type of way towards this guy .. & recently me & my boyfriend had sex & that guy came to my mind while having sex & it felt good and wrong at the same time .. idk what this means .. idk if life is testing my loyalty or if this is something else :/ .. pls any advice is well needed (I’m open minded and can take any advice fyi)
