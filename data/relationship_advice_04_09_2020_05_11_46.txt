Oh I feel so ashamed 😂 well here it goes, there was a guy I crushed for a loooong while and I decided I would tell him I liked him and I did! (On chat never spoke irl)Even tho I heard from friends he was “weird” and I was “too pretty for him” (watevs that’s subjective i still liked him a lot) I don’t mind weirdness and I really liked him but later I found out earlier that a year he used to had a crush on a new friend of mine and he used to follow her around and then I found that also happened with another girl i knew I felt so damn jealous so I stopped talked to him once he tried to speak  to me but I was sooo nervous I escaped 😂 I was basically an adult (19) and I still acted like that (I have my reasons like I’m shy, I liked him a lot, and I was taught all my life that girls shouldn’t pursue guys, Also never really been approached by a crush of mine because I barely have crushes but when I do I get crushed HARD) watevs I acted out of nervousness and shame, then a year later HE WAS IN ONE OF MY CLASSES oh god it was awful I felt so ashamed (it was this winter) and I always sat with my friends to avoid him (out of shame) but I still like enjoyed and thirsted in silence 😂😂 then when the semester was over (because we had a class group chat) I got his number and apologized about my behavior and I explained everything that i just said (except for the part of he liking my friends) and he was pretty nice and I was happy about speaking to him and I felt so warm inside but then he started saying some sexual innuendos and idk it didn’t felt right and I told him about my parents that don’t let me date and he ghosted me 😂 I used to forget about all this mess but he got an insta and it’s on my recommended followers crap I cant see his face without cringing XD ugh well idk hope he’s ok and at least I made him feel good about himself and i was never rude 🤷‍♀️
