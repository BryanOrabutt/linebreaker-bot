It all started 3 years ago. It was a cold and stormy night, well actually, it was in the high seventies, I just wanted to make it sound like your classic scary story, but this is far from it anyway. Anyway, it was a warm summer night,with light rain, and I had my window open,I was just reading, writing, thinking, and playing my ukulele,my typical peaceful calm night. But what I’m about to tell you was far from peaceful...                      I heard my name being called, relatively loud. I was startled, but I thought maybe it was a surprise visit from one of my friends, since I have some pretty crazy friends, but what I got was very different. I looked down, expecting to see one of my friends waiting for me, but it wasn’t, just the darkness of the night, I’ve never liked darkness, and the events that took place that night make me hate it even more. For some reason I can’t explain, I was drawn to further out in the field, near the lake I usually read by and eat my lunch at during the day, but not because of the lake, like I said it was something I can’t explain. Suddenly, I had no control over my movements, I was terrified, petrified even. I remember feeling like a robot, moving but not human like, and like I said, I couldn’t control my movements. I remember walking downstairs and putting my shoes on, even thought I didn’t want to. I shut the door and ran into the blackness of the night, and once I got near the lake, I saw something that I didn’t see when I peered out the window, a figure. I heard a whisper “come with me, I can show you things...” I had no control over my movements or dedications, it’s like I was impaired, or like I said before, a robot. I tried to speak, but couldn’t,so I just nodded and went with him. We walked far far past the lake, and went deep into the dark woods. I was so scared, I didn’t want to be there, but I couldn’t go back. He dragged me and we came to a circle, set up like a cult. I remember them repeating something along the lines of “I won’t tell if you won’t” and inaudible whispers. Suddenly, one pulled out a knife, and slit his own wrist and everyone else in the circles wrists, they looked up and said “oh, she’s finally here” and they drew the knife close to me, I panicked,I couldn’t move or even scream, but tears just rolled down my face at the speed of light, suddenly, I’m not sure how, a miracle of some sort, but I got the life back in me, I screamed and ran before they could harm me, I ran faster than I’ve ever ran before, and the figure chased after me, for some reason I had an urge to jump in the lake instead of just going into my house and locking all my doors and windows, to this day I still don’t know why, but anyway, I did jump in the lake, it was so cool, so refreshing. But then that’s when he jumped in after me, he tried choking me underwater, and I couldn’t breathe, but I just barely got back up, and i got out of the lake, ran into the house, and he chased me for a minute, but then he stopped. I still don’t know why, but I will never forget this, and I will never open my window again....
