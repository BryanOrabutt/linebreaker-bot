Its been a little while and I haven't shared much lately im still actively Astral Traveling when I put enough effort into it but on my off time I do research on the subject from time to time. Id like to share this CIA file I came across a long while back that im sure most of you havent even heard of let alone read but it goes into detail about  **Consciousness**  travel the reason i'm sharing this is to further educate some of you on the military's research into such subjects and can be a good starting point for  some good information and tips into possible consciousness travel. To compress some of the lengthy file ill attach here [Gateway Experience CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) the CIAs been using Monroe tapes to train some of there agents to guard sensitive sites through the use of said tapes which can be found for free on iptorrents  by looking up  Hemisync : the gateway experience how much effort you put into it is completely up to you the tapes work as a hynotic setup to train your mind by basically playing it over and over again so its fresh in your head then practicing said methods without the tapes on your own time. There are classes that you can take at the Monroe institute attached link here [Monroe Institute Out Of Body](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/products/out-of-body-experience) Although incredibly expensive and probably not worth it unless you have the 2k+ money to spend and the want to actually learn. I'd imagine there methods are a little more advance and limited to the facility they have and the equipment they have on hand stuff you probably cant buy online But the site is interesting to navigate and read the different programs they have and then research them through other means. I hope this can be informative and maybe solidify some real world uses on Astral and for those non-believers out there who have yet to have an actual OBE. For my advice on relatively successful projection thats worked for me set an alarm for 5 hours or so after you fall asleep doing this will wake you up in a groggy state of mind. You have a good 5 mins or so before your body fully wakes up take this time to focus on your frontal lobe and keep your mind active could lead to higher success rates than trying to get vibrations at the begging of your night and failing only to fall asleep.
