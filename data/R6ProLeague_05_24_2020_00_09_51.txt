House= Wouldn't mind House in ranked since we have maps like Chalet and Outback still. I thing it has some interesting level design rooms(Ex. Reading Room and the new part of the map,Tv,Music and Living room),but it would be very strange to have that on ranked,because it's a very different map from the others. Anyways,it's a fun map for casual(More than Chalet and Outback at least LUL). My idea still remains we should have only competitve maps in ranked.                                                                                   Melusi is very strong,i think removing 1 Banshee,and remove the C4 for the Bulletproof would be a good idea.Main priblem is every secondary gadget fist so well on her,and i think those 2 are probably the most balanced for her.                                                                      Still not sure of Ace,he is very counterable with impacts/bandit trick(You can even shot them trough the small halls he makes)but you should easily destroy a part of the wall especially if you can't do the impact trick on the wall. I don't thing he will replace any hard breacher but he will be definetely a good pick,especially if 2 hard breachers are banned(Like Thermite and Maverick).                                                                              Your toughts?
