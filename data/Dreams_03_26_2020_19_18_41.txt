I’ve had this nightmare twice now. For context I live with my dad. I used to live with my stepdad and mom.  I have 4 siblings on my moms side and 1 sibling on my dads side. On my moms side I have 3 brothers and 1 sister. My brothers on are 12, 9, and 2. In this dream though only my 2 brothers (the 12 year old and 9 year old) are present. This dream is a little bit crazy and it will not sound like a nightmare but trust me the fear I felt when waking up and in the dream was crazy. In my dream my brothers and I are in a neighborhood and we’re being chased by my mom. My brothers took it as a game but I was desperately trying to get away from her. I didn’t take it as a game. So we’re in this neighborhood and for some reason we run in and out of houses and hide there or we hide in the cars of random people. Pretty crazy I know but stick with me. One of the houses we go into and it was kind of abandoned but not if that makes any sense lmao. We run into this house and for some reason my stepdads mom is there. Then we get stuck watching avatar the last air bender for 2 years LMAO. It’s weird I know I don’t understand. Then there’s a middle part that has nothing to do with this dream at all. It was like a commercial on tv but a separate dream and we come back to the nightmare. So we’re running from her and we’re in the back of this blue pickup truck. I’m looking out the window in the back and I see her coming down the street and I start breaking down in tears and shaking. Then it ends and I wake up. It’s short but I woke up scared. Genuinely scared. There’s other parts to this dream but they don’t relate to this whatsoever. The neighborhood doesn’t look familiar either. It looks nothing like a neighborhood I’ve seen before. I just wanted to get it off my chest because I’ve been thinking of it a lot today.
