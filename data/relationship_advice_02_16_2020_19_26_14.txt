(India) I (23M) never been in a romantic relationship or spoke to a lot of girls before (it's common here in India). I used to work in a company. There was a cute girl (21F) there whom I was a little interested in. We both were hired at the same time. After a few months of joining the company, she made it very obvious that she is way more interested in me than i was in her. Call me an idiot but I did not ask her out because of many reasons. For over a period of nearly 4 to 5 months, i used to do my work sitting in different places but she used to follow me and we used to talk regularly like friends. During that time, she gave me numerous signals that she's interested in me. She never spoke about it but on several occasions she made it clear that she wants me to make a move. I was actually surprised that she is interested in me because I used to think she's out of my league. Anyways, I left the company 2 months ago. I knew she wanted me to stay in the company but never spoke about that. Since then, i couldn't stop thinking about her. I thought it will go away with time but the thoughts are growing stronger with time. I had few conversations with her on separate occasions where she again showed interest (used a heart in New year wishes). Call me a bigger idiot, but i still didn't ask her out. But later she started showing disinterest (giving one word responses that too very late and sometimes not replying at all). The thoughts were still growing and finally yesterday I called her and I told her that i think about her all the time and i am not able to stop thinking about her and i want to meet her. She laughed and asked if it is a prank to which I said that it is the last thing I would prank about. Then I told I want to meet her. Then she said she'll message me and hung up the phone. Now I'm not sure if she is really interested in me anymore and would really want to meet me. But if she meets me, will it be appropriate to bring up about the signals she gave earlier?
