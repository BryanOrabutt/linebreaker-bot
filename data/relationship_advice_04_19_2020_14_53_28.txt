I (21m) have been with my gf (22f) for 7 months. When we first met she talked about all her exes and how her last ex was amazing. Now she tells me that I am the best but I don't believe it. She tells me I am handsome and attractive but I don't believe it either because I don't see it. She also has told me the type of man she likes and I am not that and cannot be that,  and her ex was exactly that, which only adds to my insecurity. She believes in 100% honesty no matter what but I still don't believe her. She has told me she loves me and I asked her if she loved me more than her last ex and she hesitated and wouldn't answer. I asked how often they would do sexual stuff and she said nearly every day, as to where with me we only do things pretty much once a month. I asked how often she would give him compliments and be loving to him and she said literally all the time. She does compliment me but it is not often at all, and is generally either neutral or cold towards me and not loving. At the beginning of the relationship with us she asked to block and remove all my exes so I did and she did the same to hers. We got into a fight one day, broke up, and not 30 minutes later she told me she was talking to her ex. We got back together the next day but it made me extremely uncomfortable because she said before that she'd want to get back with an ex if we broke up. I've tried talking to her about my insecurities numerous times but she just gets frustrated or annoyed and tells me the same thing, that she loves me more, I am the best boy, and I am attractive etc. But obviously there is a fuck ton of evidence against it. I just feel kinda stuck I guess and I don't know how I am ever going to feel like I am good enough. My insecurities are eating me alive and I am tempted to turn back to substance abuse. What the fuck do I do? I hate myself and I don't know why I think this way.
