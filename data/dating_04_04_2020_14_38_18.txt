Okay so I met a guy about a year ago. I was having a boring night. He approached me and I had nothing else to do and shortly after he had left the bar so I drove him home and that was it. I listened to his drunk nonsense and whining and just dropped him off. He also talked about possibly wanting a relationship though and was super appreciative of the ride. Before he left though he got my number and we exchanged social media. We hung out again afterwards. The very first time we hung out after that he tried really hard to get sex and didn’t even want foreplay and was super pushy and somehow made me feel like I had to do it. The way he went about it was a total turn off. Anyway, I ended up having to tell him that I got molested when I was in preschool and he calmed it down after that and we just went to bed. I stayed angry at him for a bit because he just pulled his penis out too :/ anyway we hung out another time after that. After he failed to have sex with me he stopped constantly drunk calling me. Anyway, so a year later he called me up out of the blue. I tried to contact him buuut he seemed disinterested. I do know he went back to jail again but didn’t wanna tell me that and gave me some excuse but yeah he showed interest but would disappear I did contact him first though. Since he’d say yes to helping me unload stuff while I was moving but never actually did it. Again, he was going in and out of jail constantly so I assumed that way why. Anyway, after all of that totally out of the blue he called me up to hang out again. I’d have to pick him up since he just got another DUI instead of taking care of his first one. I asked if I could nap first before getting him and he said “probably not” then followed by “no”. I asked him why. We would be hanging out at his friends house and his friend didn’t like the “hesitation”. Whatever. I went there and kept him up to date about when I would be there and when I left. Anyway, I made it there and he wouldn’t answer his phone or Facebook. I called and texted and waited awhile. I also knocked on his door a few times. Why is he doing this ? The last time he called me up out of the blue and made plans he did pretty much the same thing but didn’t make me go out of his way for him. Something seemed off and I felt that birthday party he invited me to didn’t even exist and I’m seeing now it probably didn’t. He busses it, bikes and walks everywhere so I don’t feel like he used me for rides. The birthday party that probably didn’t even exist was super close to him anyway. But yeah … why is he doing this? He also won’t give me $5 in gas money. I went 38 mins out of my way and wasted my time. Plus I had to go back. He told me he fell asleep and that he was sorry. I was being mean to him about it via Facebook. I sent him some really aggressive texts after asking for $5 in gas money and getting no reply. He hasn’t deleted me off of social media or anything though. He never really seems angry when I flip out on him or say mean stuff. I think he knows he deserves it. Anyway, he has an alcohol problem and I think a cocaine problem too. His dad used to have a restraining order on him because he has assaulted him and broke into his house. I’ve seen him give change to homeless people when he has nothing but he used to be homeless. So maybe he’s not that bad of a person. I really don’t know 🤷‍♀️ Anyway, I’m a 22F and he’s a 28M. What is up with this guy and what is the point of these games? Should I be angry at him or Should I just understand he’s mentally unstable and maybe means no harm? Because Idunno what he does seems just  so rude, inconsiderate and childish … but Yeah what’s the point of all of this? What do you guys think?
