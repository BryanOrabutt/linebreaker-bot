I think my brain was really craving that dopamine. Was it worth it? No. I've been struggling to control myself, and I think these alternate routes that aren't necessarily porn aren't good. Just, avoid lewd media in general. It will get you, searching for the next hit of dopamine, only to be struck by regret afterwards. I want to be my best self, and yet, I feel trapped in my own indulgences. I'm not sure how to press on, now. Maybe this time I'll really do it, but I doubt it. I'm craving dopamine, and I feel like I'm just going insane. School is ramping up, and I'm just stressed about it, so this I guess is my way out. I don't think I can do NoFap all that well. I feel like it's just impossible for me. I told myself that I was doing this for my girlfriend, so I can be a better person for her. Now back to square one, I'm scared of even talking to her, because I feel like I'm not the person she deserves. I feel like I don't have much happiness in my life, and am just going to fuck up so much. I check this reddit thread plenty, but I still end up regressing. I really don't know how to live a better life, and when porn has become my outlet for about a year now, it feels inescapable. I've read countless stories about NoFap changing lives, and I can only get past a few days because I'm leading a shitty life, not feeling good enough for anyone, and just shutting myself up. I don't see a way out. I want those 90+ day benefits, man. I want to feel good enough for others. I want to be happy with myself. I want to accomplish my own goals. Maybe it's just the current month I'm in, where I've had to put my personal goals to the side for school. Maybe it's quarantine. Or maybe, I'm just fucked up. I know this community is supportive, and that's why I'm making this post to begin with. I'm not sure if there's any good advice to give, what would make a better life, etc. I don't know how to get out of this hell I've made for myself.
