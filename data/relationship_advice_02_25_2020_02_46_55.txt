So I dated this girl for 6 months and in that time she was smoking weed, which I was fine with. I had told her that I was fine with her smoking but that if she did anything else, like pills or stuff like that, I didn’t know if I could handle it. I’ve seen to many people I love almost die because of it so it scares me. She told me she had no interest in doing anything other than smoking weed. Fast forward to about a week ago when she called me around 9 pm and started the call off with please don’t be mad at me. I told her I wasn’t going to be but to tell me what was wrong. She said that she had bought 2 dab pens from her friend. I told her it was fine but she said that, that was not all. She said that she had bought 5 pills of Xanax. I told her that she shouldn’t take them and to throw them away. She got mad at me and asked if I was going to pay her back for them. I told her no and she said that if it made me feel any better that she would take them while I was on the phone with her. I told her fuck no, because if anything was to happen I wouldn’t be able to do anything to help. She hung up in me and called me the next morning and said that she didn’t care what I thought about her, she had taken 2 of them that night. I told her that I didn’t know if I could continue seeing her anymore. She started arguing with me about how I was blowing this out of proportion and to grow up. I told her that it was over and that I still wanted to be friends with her because I still cared about her. She told me to go fuck myself and hung up. I texted her later that night trying to just talk but she hasn’t answered. I tried to talk to her friend to tell her to just call me but she just told me to screw off and leave her alone. I still care about this girl and don’t want her to get hurt, should I just let it go or what?
