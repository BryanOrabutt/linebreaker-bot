This WILL get confusing but try to bear with me. Ok, so I have 3 good friends in my friend group right now, we’ll just call them a, b and c. So, my friend a, who I’ve been friends with since 1st grade, I don’t want to be friends with him anymore. He’s really annoying and never talks about anything relevant. He literally only talks about Star Wars and football all year long. He also has major anger issues, so he’ll just get super pissed out of the slightest problems. I don’t want to confront him about it because of said anger issue. I just don’t get good vibes from him. Here’s where it gets pretty confusing. Once I’m no longer friends with A, since all he does is hang out with B, my current best friend, I won’t be able to hang out with B anymore. C isn’t really involved with A so he’s ok, but it’s me not being with B that’s concerning. Right now, there are two schools in my town that have grades 3-5 and then we merge in the middle school in 6. Once I’m there, B has a lot of good friends in the other school and so do A and I. But if A is with them, then I might grow away from them too. Leaving me with only C as a friend. I have some other friends, but one will totally pick a fight with me and one way or another we’ll hate each other, and the other kid is only kind of my friend. I’m sure I’ll have other kids that would be my friend from the other school, but I don’t want them to be associated with A because like I said before, I just don’t get good vibes from him. So I don’t know if I should try and get a girlfriend, but I mean, I’ve already been rejected by someone that I liked a lot so I don’t know if I can just develop feelings for someone else, or work it out with my friends. I know the obvious answer is just to work it out with my friends, but I just don’t know how. That’s where I need help as I’m in a bit of a pickle.
