What I think causes it to happen so that it becomes you train of thought learning about things like online or in a book usually with images causes you mind to think for an example would be an image with a world on it as well as a missal next to it view from outer space and the book says the missal will land on earth just as an example and if you look at the image you see the image I said earlier witch is a missal with a world earth on it from a view of space and if you take a look at the missal you see it as the size of the world-Earth then that causes the mind to take a picture of the picture within your mind thus it trying to resize the image into the real view of what it should really look like from space according to what  knowledge you have from the view of earth from space and if you seen  a missile in real life or in a movie you know approximately the size of the missile then making the correct image within your mind and you end up viewing it with the real  sizes of the symbols earth missile another example would be a pen if someone told you to grab that pen on my table for me of something as that as you go to grab the pen you first view th0 table within the mind and locate yourself in the area of the room then you turn and without much thinking you head for the table making your way there you clear the way to the table from the obstacle ahead of you these obstacles is what I would call a different view of mind set maybe for activities and things that take action to work and they also take up less mind set viewing making it easier simply to live it anyways as you get to the table you see the table and instantly it is a table within your mind because you already marked the location of it then you see the papers and all that on the table witch is obvious enough to decode seeing that you know what a table is then you search the table for said pen then you see two pens you think of which on to choose if you are a photographic memory type especially when seeing that the pens are right next to each other you choose the one that probably choose the best one witch describes to being a pen and in choosing the pen you then realize a process that happens within the mind without knowing the process and end up being satisfied within because of being correct within you mind of witch best described a pen and the process that happens within the mind is probably a decoding process that allows you to see life and understand it and its meanings and then them not being new to you but satisfying to the mind and eyes still because of the process that goes on within the mind andmany other tiny processes that I probably don't know of  yet
