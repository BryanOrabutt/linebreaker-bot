Hey guys so I’m going to try to explain this without making it confusing! So there is this guy that I’ve known since I was a kid we kind of grew up together in the same neighborhood and I never even found him attractive or had any feelings for him. We have mutual friends and one night we were out at a bar we just clicked and from then we started basically becoming FWB. But I wasn’t too excited about it because we would only hook up like twice a month or even just one time. I started catching feelings for him because when we were together we would non stop be talking and having convo and Vibing. I knew I wanted to tell him how I feel because my motto life is short. So I decided to text him one night and tell him I wanted to be more than FWB and even talk more and actually hangout and stuff. He was really caught off guard he had no idea I felt this way because I hid it. He told me he’s glad that I told him how I felt but he felt weird if we started talking more (possibly because he’s friends with my older brother).. he keep stating he really was shocked and caught off guard and he kept saying tell me how you really feel. so I told him basically a little more but I told him I understand and thanked him for being honest because I didn’t wanna start persuading him why he should talk more to me. I thought it was over but then he continued to text me and tell me that he wouldn’t want me to get hurt by him and that he’s not in a good head space. But then continued to tell me if I want to talk more to text him the next day. So does he really not want me anymore? If he didn’t want too why would he keep texting me after ? Is there no chance for US? He just was so sweet about this whole thing and then started to open up to me in the texts too about how he’s been feeling but stating he doesn’t wanna fuck me over. I didn’t text him today even tho he said if I wanted too I could.. I don’t even know what to say?
