I'm so pissed.  I live in a dorm and share a bathroom with one person and common areas with 3 other people.  Their all friends and like to bitch about everything in the common room. They have decided that finals week is the best time to be loud.  I can handle all this but the roommate I share a bathroom with has a serious problem.  She doesn't clean up after herself. I mean she leaves her clothes on the bathroom floor for days.  She sheds like a dog and doesn't know how to clean up after herself.  I constantly find her eyebrow pencils and other stuff like that on the floor.  I mean is it so hard to pick it up?  Seriously! I don't wanna clean up after her.  Then I hear her ranting about how I don't do shit. I am not about to pick up another person's underwear off the floor that's just nasty.  We have decided that we clean the bathroom weekly.  But this bitch doesn't do shit. I'm not confrontational so I just suck it up, but what gets to me is that she sends me these texts saying her it's your turn to clean up.  I just wanna scream at her and tell her that she's the one that makes a mess.  It doesn't help that the 3 roommates are all friends so they gang up on me. It makes my blood boil.  I don't even cook anymore cause they always leave their nasty dishes in the sink saying that it's "soaking". You don't soak dishes for 3 days.  You have a sponge use it!!!! I seriously need some advice on what to do.  She is manipulative and uses others to gang up on me.  She has just made my roommate experience absolute hell.  It's come to the point where I don't even go back to my room until its midnight cause she always comes up to me and says it's your week to clean.  It was my week to clean last week and the week before that.  Is it so hard to wipe down the sink and not let your toothpaste just sit on the sink?  On top of all this, she touches my stuff. Who does that?  I'm about to lose it.  Help!
