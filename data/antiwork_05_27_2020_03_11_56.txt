For a long time as a person into the conspiracy stuff I was against socialism and most conspiracy people still are, but now I recognize that the conspiracy and socialist movements should not be against each others ideas, instead it would be better if they both embraced the other's ideas. Noncompete did kind of wake me up to what is wrong about capitalism, And the movie psywar did alot too. I am planning myself to make a post like this in r/conspiracy about socialism, Alot of socialists will be aware of lobbying, CIA coups, Cointelpro and stuff like that, but many other socialists would say the idea of false flags are stupid. Alot of CIA coups involve false flags themselves. I will go over the more easily provable and non controversial ones. Operation Ajax which was the coup in Iran involved false flags, the CIA blamed communists and  the prime minister Mosaddegh for bombings the CIA did themselves. This was done because Mossaddegh wanted to nationalize Iran's oil. This ended up in the shah doing a coup and he let the oil companies in. Operation gladio was allegedlt a plan to make stay behind armies incase the ussr invaded, but they were used to do false flags in europe and the bombings were blamed on communists. Radical reviewer is a socialist himself and he is a 9/11 truther, another socialist conspiracy person is Webster Tarpley, Don't let all the flippantly right wing elements of the conspiracy movement turn you off to conspiratorial information. I know that most of you think Illuminati type conspiracies are dumb and distract from the 1% being the problem, but not only do I think they are not dumb, I think they are very compatible. Part of Illuminati are the 1% themselves other elements pf the 1% are puppets. When it comes to the most provable conspiracy theory, I would say it is the fact that Timothy Mcveigh and Terry Nichols didn't act alone in Oklahoma city. There is a abc local news report that was filmed live and on the scene they were talking about multilple bombs that were in the building. The official story is that only one truck bomb was used. Terrence yeakey was also on the scene when the bombing happened and he got killed and his death was falsely ruled a suicide, he was killed because he knew too much about what really happened here is a good playlist about Oklahoma city [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwx17F4c\_4r\_HuhpQJJi7d6KUmqWCSrG4](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwx17F4c_4r_HuhpQJJi7d6KUmqWCSrG4) here is a seperate list of conspiracy videos, the first one is about Jack Ruby saying a conspiracy was behind him.
