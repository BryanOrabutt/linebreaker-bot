I hate that I’m put in this decision to choose between my husband and kids because I love both of them with all of my heart, but at the end of the day I gotta choose my kids. With people who might not know my oldest daughter (5) got expelled from school for attacking her teacher and the school counselor told me to go take her to psychiatrist that specialized in mental health and children. I ended up taking her and after 4 visits with the psychiatrist, she basically told me that My daughter outburst are not because of any mental disorder that she perfectly fine and normal. But it comes from us as a pair.which I did kinda expected. my daughter pretty much told her that her dad ( my husband) screams,spanks and swears at her and her siblings all the time. Which she isn’t lying it’s my fault.  Also that she says I never pay attention to her that I don’t care about her. Which really hurt me because I’m pretty much failing as her parent. The psychiatrist then told me she wants to meet with us as a pair ASAP. So then I told my husband about this and he basically wants nothing to do with it ,his exact words were “ the therapist is for her and not me. I don’t need know damn lady telling me how to parent.” One of his traits is that he’s very stubborn so i wasn’t surprised.i know he loves are daughters very much.. but if he doesn’t want to put in the work for to be better for our children and a family then I might leave him. Which freaking sucks because I love my husband he was once my best friend and helped me create are 4 daughters ( soon to be 5 expecting another). He provided for me and the kids solely alone because I don’t have to work. But then again I love my kids and there well being matters more I don’t want them living in a toxic household. I’m not saying this is all my husbands fault because I played a major part in it too. But I’m just conflicted on what to do if he doesn’t want to put in work to be a better family...
