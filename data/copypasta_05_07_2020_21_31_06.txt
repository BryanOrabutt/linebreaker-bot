WOW. First Naughty Dog has the audacity to put a woman in their gane that I don't want to beat my meat to. Now this?! I don't know if you've noticed fellow gamers, but we're losing this war against SJW snowflakes who just want to ruin our games. I can't believe cd projekt red would do this. After all of the years of being a company that stands with gamer rights and now they want to shove their political crap down our throats. They're ruining their games and their reputation by turning their back on their true beliefs for the sake of 'woke' twitter users. Well I'm not having it. I for one, will NOT be buying this game, and I encourage you all to do the same. By taking this stance in their games, the aren't just ruining cuberpunk, but are DESTROYING the quality of all the games they've released up to this point. There was a long period of time in which I held the belief that the witcher 3 was the best game, no the best form of entertainment media, to ever be released to the masses. NOT ANYMORE! I will never be able to play the game, that I once thought was immaculate, EVER AGAIN! And its all because of this woke drivel they choose to shove in our faces. NO MORE. I will no longer stand for this. WE NEED TO START SPEAKING WITH OUR WALLETS! I didn't even bother reading the article, so I'm not sure what these politics are that they're talking about, but I'll bet my dad's WHOLE estate that they're going to force a woman somewhere she doesn't belong. Maybe WORSE. Maybe they'll make us refer to Keanu Reeves as HE half of the cutscenes and SHE the other half. Its so STUPID! Why would they do that, you may ask? Well because they want us to believe something that simply ISN'T TRUE! I'm done with all of it. I don't even hate the gays, I just don't want to have to be reminded they exist. SERIOUSLY FELLOW GAMERS, WE NEED TO LET THESE COMPANIES KNOW! WE DON'T WANT GAME DEVELOPERS TALKING DOWN TO US, WE DON'T WANT NARRATIVES CRITICISING OUR GOVERNMENT, WE DON'T WANT YOU TAKING AWAY OUR BIG ANIME TIDDIES!!! WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?!?!
