I’ve been casually dating a man 20 years older than me. We met at work 2 years ago and just started talking/hooking up as of 6 months ago. ( I had just gotten out of a relationship and he claims he and his live in gf broke up as well but I am still unsure of this....)  First few months it started out very sexual... asking for nudes, hooking up any chance we could, sexting, all that. About 3 months I got in my head and starting being distant bc I could tell I was becoming attached. He noticed and asked what was up and I told him how I felt and he agreed that he had felt the same! So now fast forward another 3 months - the sexual texts have slowed and I am seeing him much less than I was at the beginning. We seem to have gotten more emotional with each other recently though which is ironic... He bought me flowers for VDAY, he gave me air pods one day as a random gift... comes to me for advice about his kids and life in general.. but the thing that bothers me the most is he doesn’t initiate much time together unless it’s coffee before work or when we are at work. He will text me over and over to come to his office to see him.. and this just ain’t cutting it for me. He does travel a lot for work and has 4 kids so I try not to take it personally... but sometimes I feel used for convenience. I really care about this guy but it gets exhausting racking my brain every day trying to fill in blanks. I know people will say “ just ask him why he has no time for you” or “why don’t you initiate” and I have thought these through as well and I just don’t want to be that annoying girl who is begging for his time. If he cares he will make time, correct? Also when I do try to initiate a date, he’s busy or will be out of town or has his kids...  I guess what I am asking is does this seem like I am being dragged along or does this guy seem genuine and is just busy with life? Everything seems to be in his terms.
