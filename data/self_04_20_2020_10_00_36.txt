 I think my brother is a sociopath, he's 13. He constantly says he's the  absolute greatest. The smartest person to step in his school. He's  impulsive and has stabbed people with pencils and sent a boy to the ER  as he slammed his head in a wall. He never felt bad for any of it. I  told him my friends ex tried to kill herself. He said I would've said  try again. He's beat students with sticks. Threatened to kill them and  much darker things like cutting their skin off and making them a coat.  He can also be charming and is actually gifted. He has manipulated  people, ruined relationships, etc. One time a boy was copying my brother  on a test, so my brother convinced him to spend 100+ dollars and made  him lose it all. He managed to lie to my mom about his relationship with  a girl completely, he managed to convince my mom that they were  talking. That same day he threatened to kill her. Lying comes easy to  him. He even mocked a girl about her suicidal attempts and mocked  another about her dead sister. He keeps files on people in the schools  to know their weakness. He is emotionless really, at our dads funeral he  didn't shed one tear. None. He's obsessed with power and money. His  girlfriend broke up with him and didn't feel a thing. He tried to date a  girl to steal her popularity and even started sports to "blend in" so  he can become popular and manipulate people easier. He's smart probably  has an IQ or 130+. All of his teachers love him. He doesn't like people.  A guy was talking bad about him. So he told me he's currently  planning  to convince the guys girlfriend to break up with him. Then get with  her, sleep with her and send him a pic. He already convinced the girl to  breakup with him by eavesdropping and finding his Snapchat password,  also finding out he was cheating. So he managed to give it to the guy's  girlfriend in a way that wasn't so obvious.
