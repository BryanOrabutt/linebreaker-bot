So on Saturday I was second shooting for another photographer and shortly after I arrived, the wedding coordinator went over to me and the other photographer and basically said that one of the groomsmen is/was drunk and just accidentally fired a gun inside the venue and there was 'shrapnel' everywhere so the venue is pressing is charges and the cops would likely be on their way soon. The coordinator told us that because she wanted us to try and knock out the groomsmen photos while he was still here in case he got taken away so I took them real quick but was nervous cause this dude was drunk and literally just shot a gun, like wtf. Most of the groomsmen are all in the army together which maybe explains why one of them had a gun but they're all like 20-22 if I had to guess so relatively young. Either way, that's a first and crazy to me. They didn‚Äôt tell the bride at all (so as not to stress her out), they told her the sound was a champagne bottle going off so that‚Äôs all she thoughtüòÖ Meanwhile 2 cop cars showed up and the dude who shot the gun is in the back of the car, I took photos of him getting in for them to remember but I don't know if they want to have those photos. They were thinking of having one of the ushers put on his clothes to replace him and keep an even 8 groomsmen but the cops wouldn‚Äôt let him change clothes. The venue owner was sooo mad, and rightfully so I mean it was super stupid and dangerous and someone could have gotten shot. We ended up having to position group shots and couples shots around the venue opposite the side of cops so that the bride wouldn‚Äôt see themüò≥ She eventually saw some of the cops inside though and was asking why they were there and they just told her ‚Äúfor security stuff‚Äù haha. Anyways the groomsmen was taken away and I don't know if she ever noticed but I did see her little brother stepped in to fill in the 8th spot, he mostly matched except his tie color was diff. Definitely one of my wilder wedding stories
