So my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago (the day Kobe passed) and since then it’s been weird between us. She lives with me since she has no place to stay (3rd time she’s lived with me in the past 2 1/2 years). Their will be days she’s out the house for days on end and then she’ll come back as if nothing happened. She said she still wanted to be friends after the break up but last Friday I guess was the last straw for her. I invited her to an event to go to that day and she never gave a clear answer not only that she had been gone from the house most of the day. She’s at work or her friends house. So I didn’t ask her about it cause I’m thinking she has plans probably. So I tell her to take an Uber to the house since I have plans with friends. So I end up going to the event and then I see her best friend and her boyfriend (who I’ve spent holidays with and have upmost respect for). She ends up texting my ex and tells her I’m there and my ex gets pissed because I didn’t ask her and said she wanted to go and her not so clear answer (she said we’ll see) was a yes pending. Moments later her friend ends up getting her an Uber to the event and I only stay for a few more minutes. She doesn’t come home that night and blocks me on social media. The next day after I get off work I see her in my room and I try to talk with her and she gets really pissed. Saying I didn’t ask and I assumed that she wasn’t gonna go and that’s why we aren’t in a relationship. So since Sunday she has been gone from my house. No communication at all. all of her stuff is still here. I don’t know where she is. A part of me wants to give her the option of making peace and letting her stay till she has the money saved up to move into her own place (which would take 4 months according to her) or just telling her to pack her stuff and go since she’s been gone out the house for days and most likely has a place to stay.
