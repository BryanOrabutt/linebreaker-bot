I really hate this ex, I really question this world for letting someone like her exist. We were together for 3-4 years, very close and a somewhat codependent relationship. When I wasnt doing so good in life, she just shut down all her feelings for me and dumped me, but still used me for attention for a week before she found someone else and cut me off. Really just disregarded everything I did for her, didn't even care about me, and even had the guts to message me only when she wants something. she's an awful person and this is coming from someone who doesn't mix emotions with thinking. Anyways, once a few months, she would message my best friend, asking about him and also talking shit about why she left me, this was during the first time she did this which was near end of last year, the second time was after a few months after that, she just messaged him again out of nowhere, asking about him again and talking like they are friends, and the third time was just a few days ago, after a few months again, messages him out of nowhere, asks about him again and talking. I'm really mad, the first time she did this, after telling my friend how upset I'm with her, he was convinced to unfriend her on social medias, during the second time, I just told him to never reply again after that, the third time when she messaged him which was a few days ago, he told me but I'm not sure if it was after they had the conversation or before, but after he told me, I just said don't reply at all, he said ok, but after a day when I asked him what she messaged him, he just told me that I shouldn't care and that nobody gives a dam about her, and gave me a summary of their texts, nothing flirty, she's just acting like he's her friend. After that I said ok don't ever reply again, he replied 'ok but I will only if its important" then I just said "no don't reply ever again" he replied ok, after a day I felt like I didn't convince him because I have told him to not reply at all because I don't want him end up helping her with anything, I showed him a screenshot of how she treated me when we talked, and said "don't reply again" and adding "block her too", and he replied "lol" and changed the topic, I really want him to stop replying her because I know her true nature, but I feel like my friend isn't really listening based on everything I typed here, so any ideas on what I should do to get him to never reply again? The only thing I could think of is going cold on him by disappearing for weeks so that he would take my word more seriously.
