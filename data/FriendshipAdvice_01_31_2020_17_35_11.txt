I have a friend/roommate that for a very long time that I’ve labeled as “too nice” but I’ve realized recently that it’s not that but it’s more like she has no backbone/can’t think for themselves (call her A). My old roommate who she was very close with too & that roommate & I had a falling out with & so she tried staying friends with both of us & not doing anything about the fact that other friend treated her so bad & used her for so many things but eventually they had a falling out too & are no longer friends. Now I live with that friend & a friend she’s had for longer than me (call her B)but we’re all friends. They have been friends longer so they are closer & sometimes it seems to cause problems. I’ve had 2 issues with them & it seems mostly because B entices A to “take her side”.  The most recent issue was B came in the other night while I was sitting in the living room with my boyfriend & she was slamming the door & throwing shit around bc she was mad that I didn’t take out the trash. She said that she was tired of doing all the work around the house because “we” didn’t do enough. I was trying to get to the point of I’d help out more & Im sorry but I didn’t like that she came in so angry & hateful. But we fought & went to our rooms & then the next day I came home from work & cleaned your the house & A & B came in & didn’t say a single word to me but then I confronted B & apologized for everything but I didn’t appreciate how she communicated. She didn’t understand where I was coming from & then said her & A both agree I don’t do enough so she was involving her & that just irritated me bc last night it was both of us not doing enough & now I guess she just needed someone to talk shit to & have be against me? Im just confused about the whole situation & wonder if someone went through something similar & what they did. It’s obvious that A has no backbone & cant think for themselves.
