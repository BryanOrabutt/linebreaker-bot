I developed a crush on this one guy in my grade(12th grade) who I began to have a crush on in my English class in November-ish. We knew one another since we’re from a relatively small town. We both knew of one another since grade school and everything. We just never really noticed one another. We were both seated by one another in class at a table with other students. Three girls including me. Also another boy who was a close friend of him. We all vibed, we were the loudest table in class since we just got along. When we would all make stupid jokes him and I would look at one another and just smile and laugh but it wasn’t intentionally at that time it was just a normal reaction. I kinda didn’t have anyone in mind that I liked at the moment but in that class this girl in front of me started to notice. She asked if I liked him and I said uh no why? At that time I wasn’t completely sure of me liking him. I just started to notice him more and same for him with me I believe? She then said that she only asked because we were always smiling and it was just cute but I just brushed it off. But the other guy that sat there with him who was a close friend of him we can call him Friend G. So Friend G and I would talk to one another and joke around but because we were just like that. The guy I liked would just listen or sometimes even jump in with him and tease too. He usually at the beginning of the school year would be in a moody behavior or just looked really tired now I know why he looked that way keep reading and you’ll find out why. After some more time we all continued to get comfortable and he even began to attend class more and on time since at the beginning he wouldn’t as much. We have a similar type of dry sarcastic humor. Him and I didn’t really talk that much, he wouldn’t talk to the other girls either just with his friend. He’s pretty reserved, but when I would talk or Friend G would ask me something he would sometimes look up or he would be on his phone but I noticed he would be listening. I started to notice him looking at me when I wasn’t, because I could just feel it and his body language was just kinda like opening to me. He would move his feet closer to me but not too much but I would pull away slowly. Or sometimes get his hand closer to me. Sometimes he even sat like me or get in the same position I was in. I don’t know might be a fucking coincidence for all I know. I noticed that he even began to dress better and started to wear cologne? Friend G noticed too because he brought up that he smelled good. He even would compliment on how he looked good and stuff like that you know that gay-ish affection(no offense please) bro’s give to their other bro’s. His friend even noticed that him and I would get glances of one another. From there he started to talk a bit more and sometimes chimed in. With Friend G, him and I had this thing where we would flip each other off and he would just laugh. I have a bad habit of dryly cussing and saying stupid phrases that would get everyone laughing in class even if I didn’t try they would just come out on their own. That’s the way I just am lol. He even asked one time “You eat with that mouth? in a sarcastic tone and I just replied yup chuckled and looked away. At a point Friend G would become way too much of an asshole or get too annoying and would ask our English teacher “Mrs. move him because he won’t leave *says my name* alone” and I would just laugh and the teacher would say “is that true?” then I would laugh and nod then say just kidding, it’s okay we’re good. This other girl that I told in the class that I was interested in him even noticed across the room that when I would be on my phone playing a game he would try to peek. Fast forward some more to this one day our table got overly loud and the teacher threatened to move us the following week since it was Friday. He even said “Mrs. please don’t move me away from my friend *says my name*” I was surprised by that.  I didn’t even say anything just turned, smiled and turned to look straight and sorta chuckle. Then I received a snap from the girl in front of me and said “dude did you hear what he even said” and I just looked up at her and have her a discreet nod. From there that weekend I balled up and decided to follow him back on instagram, he was already following me which I didn’t even noticed so I requested him. Then the next night I added him on snap and he added me back. From there I just sat back and waited to see when to make my move or if he would. We were never sat by one another again since they moved us but we would sometimes get peeks of one another. Or see each other in the hallways but would look away. Fast forward to January, it was his birthday on the 17th. He posted on his story I slid up and said Happy Birthday he replied and from there we began texting. He kept the conversation going, he even invited me to hang out about 3 times or more. But they weren’t like dates it was just to chill, but it was a bit too early for me I don’t know it just kinda freaked me out so I just told him an excuse. Later on I asked him to hang out but he couldn’t. After that about a week or 2 passed and he mentioned it again but didn’t say what day. For these past months we kept texting non stop. I think there was even like a week that on Snapchat we got the best friend emoji but lost it because I would tend to get busy. Anyways we just kept texting and it was going well. We got comfortable with one another always “good morning texts and goodnight sweet dreams” texts. He even sent me snaps of Friend G when I would ask what he was doing and he would tell me he was out with him or this other close friend of him we can call him Friend V. We never really sent snaps of ourselves like of our whole face just of what we were doing or up to, just casual. There was some times he would ask me to send him a snap of myself. Like whenever I told him I wore glasses and he wanted to see what I looked like with them on. But I didn’t because I told him straight up and honest that I was high and he just laughed and understood. Or when this one time I did end up sending him a video because I had trimmed one of my eyelashes on accident. I had mentioned it to him and he wanted to see since I don’t really like to send face snaps, I don’t know it’s just kinda weird for me. But sometimes he’d ask me to since I just never really would openly send them on my own like normal teenage girls do nowadays. It’s not really my thing and honestly I’m not bad looking. I don’t want to hype myself up either but just so you guys can sorta understand my situation more I’ll give a description. (I’m around 5’5, curvy body with broad shoulders but not that much, I’m sorta of like an a alpha female, really independent, I’m charismatic with some people because they always say hi to me in the hallway or hug me. I apparently look smart from what people tell me. Or I also get that I can be kinda intense or look intimidating. I don’t know why they might say that because I’m a blind bitch and I tend to just look straight ahead into nothing since I can’t see, I don’t do it on purpose I genuinely just can’t see. Also my fault because o don’t tend to wear my glasses to school. When you get to know me more I’m cute & soft but from the outside I give off like a tough exterior or just look quiet lol.  I‘m tan, curly jet black hair, medium length, sorta of a baby face like small nose, small ears, good eyebrows, hooded brown eyes, strong cheekbones, decently good smile, pouty small lips, a average amount of cleavage but I keep it classy all the time and I’m pretty quiet sometimes but when I’m comfortable or depending the vibe I’m really charismatic and making people laugh with my humor or sarcasm. I’m an interesting mix) Another point is that I’m kinda underrated or low key in my opinion because I don’t date around, no one has actually seen me out with a guy because I just don’t really like to talk with many guys at once. I also don’t post much on my social media, like at all. I haven’t posted a single selfie since like middle school but my instagram is clear of anything I post nothing on there. It’s just to connect with people and scroll around and look at memes. I’ll be nice and respond to some guys that try to text me but if I’m not interested I’ll kinda be more of a supportive friend and tell them to let me know if they need anything. I’m pretty mysterious too, no one really knows much about me deep down. Some girls that are my friends do and only like one close friend guy also knows me good enough. That’s why him and I are still good friends. Also mostly because we like the same things but we wouldn’t date one another. Well I hope you guys can get an idea of me now. So I can proceed anyways we just had good conversations and we really got to know one another since we never really talked in that way. Occasionally I noticed that he would become distant all of a sudden but I had patience with him and wouldn’t double text or anything just give him his space. He’s pretty reserved(he’s a Capricorn and I’m an Aquarius) so I just assumed he was going through something or just busy. In February on my birthday he waited till midnight to tell me, he was the first one and honestly that day was shit so I didn’t go to school and he asked why I didn’t go and I just told him that I wasn’t feeling it. he offered to listen to what was going on but I told him that no thank you and that I would be okay but I appreciated it. He understood and we just kept texting and went on going with our day. Fast forward a bit I was feeling as if I was bugging him and felt him pulling away and I could see he was ignoring me because I noticed he would not answer back after like a certain amount of hours but his snapscore would kinda go up by a bit. It was unusual of him. I know you guys reading right now are like wow this girl is psycho or something but I don’t like to be annoying or waste people’s time or them waste mine. So I told him that if he wasn’t feeling it that we could stop talking to one another and that I was understanding of it and he said no that it was okay. That he liked talking to me because I was “funny and everything” but that he felt like he would bug me sometimes and I told him that I felt the same way towards him, that that’s why I was asking. We fixed that but later on he started telling me he was having issues and had stuff going on and I would try to help him up and fill him with positivity, tell him everything was going to be okay and to find the good in the bad. I would tell him about how he was a good quality person and etc. He would appreciate it and thank me for giving him advice like that. He would be there for me too. I would help him with work for class and when I would miss class he would also offer help. He would say thank you and that he appreciated it and that because of me he was being able to pass class. When I would feel down he would offer to listen if I needed to talk but I’m not that open like that and I would tell him that everything would be okay and thank him for offering. Later on we did gain more trust and he told that sometimes he would get stressed and I would also open up to him on how I felt as well and told him it was okay to not always feel okay. That not every day was gonna be a good one and how we just needed to be positive. Another small detail here is that we wouldn’t talk in class, like at all we avoided one another. As if we were just acquaintances or just people that wouldn’t talk to one another. I was fine with that and he seemed like he was too, we’re both shy and reserved like that and kept it low key. We were still seated away form one another. In this 2nd semester we were in Friend G got out of the class because he started working night shifts. So I stopped seeing him. Another thing I noticed is that some of his other guy friends, Friend A and S who I talked to as well not fully but at least I would sometimes say hi to them because we’ve known each other since we were little, started to not even say hi to me which I found weird they just kept looking straight or just not notice me in the halls. Only like once Friend A did notice me because I got in the way of him on accident and he pulled my hair and kept walking. Anyways back to what we would talk about, well he would ask me about my day and what I was up to and when I would ask him in return he wouldn’t really tell me much just that he was out and about. At one point I noticed we kinda co-depended on one another which is super bad. So this one time we kinda went through an obstacle and we push one another away or just started to not contact one another as often as we usually would. We never left each other on read or anything just kinda gave more space to one another but we always replied back when we had time that same day. Then we went back to talk like normal I’m guessing he would just get busy or was going through something. I would also go through the same. So anyways now it’s March, we’re talking good and one day mid conversation it came up and I mention to him that we should hang out.  He says yes and I ask him what day? He tells me he’s available from Monday-Thursday from 5 to whatever time. I decided on a Wednesday. Which took place this last Wednesday the 11th. Fast forward to that Wednesday I let him know to not make plans after 6. The reason I said that was because he had told me the day that we were planning on this whole hanging out thing, to let him know in an hour in advance. So after I told him the whole don’t do anything after 6 thing he just asked me “why?” “I might go to Mexico but why?” (We live close to the border) I was sorta upset because I thought he would’ve remembered, we had planned on it that past week. So I replied “never mind then, it’s okay” But I understand, guys can be forgetful like that so I calmed down. He then replied “Never mind that got cancelled” I replied with “are you sure?” He replied with “Yeah it’s tomorrow when I’m going out of town” then in my head I was like okayyy and but proceeded to ask “So is that a yes to hang then?”. He then said that it was up to me if I still wanted to then I replied with “but do you want to or I mean it’s okay if you had other plans, I understand”. Then he said “well if you want” the thing is that he said it in a way that just made me felt like I was forcing him go hang out or maybe not but I kinda did felt like that. I was getting frustrated but I kept calm. I got that way because I don’t like wasting people’s time or getting my time wasted. I had showed signs that I was interested in him because I supported him and all of that stuff and he sorta gave me signs that he was too. He appreciated it and I know that because he would tell me. He also mention that if I ever needed anything to just let him know. There’s more details in this whole situation between us that also happened but this is already getting pretty long to even add them. Anyways I was pretty upset and didn’t answer him till 8:30ish. I replied saying that it was okay and that I understood and with that I just told him straight up that I needed to clear the air and wanted to talk to him. About whether we would be continuing with this talking and mentioned on how I didn’t want to catch these little feelings and for them to be one sided and one of us to get hurt. Something in those words, I was just anxious as I tend to get like that once I’m high. The reason I felt like that was because this is my first time actually trying with a guy and I’m scared of getting hurt. I know it’s part of life and it lets you learn lessons but I’m just like that. Anyways he opens the chat, he replies quickly saying “I came to *name of next town over” so later when I get back, I’ll let you know? So we can talk?” I almost shitted myself and started to fucking shake. I was honestly ready for him to reject me or something. I was just really scared of this going to a longer extent and after all that, him just not feeling the same way. So I bossed up. (Like I mentioned earlier this is my first time really shooting my shot, I typically don’t get involved with guys at my school or just any guy. I have talked with guys but if I’m not feeling it genuinely then I won’t waste his time or just play with him. I do have that one good guy friend though but I didn’t tell him about this situation because I wanted to keep it low key). Anyways it’s 10:40ish, I start thinking that he’s not even going to text me back. He posts on his story that he’s drinking with his friends. So I proceed to get undressed and ready for bed saying “Damn. these guys really ain’t shit dawg”  When I receive a snap from him and it says “if you want rn would be okay?” and reply with “yeah give me a minute” he then replies with “where do you want to meet?” I give him directions to meet me at one of the school parking lots. I jump out of bed, go straight to my parents room and woke up my mom. I tried to lie to her that one of my friends was at my other friends house and asked for me to go over because she needed help to comfort the other friend because her mom kicked her out of the house blah blah blah and so she agrees. Only because she really likes that friend of mine and because she usually does go through shit like that. Anyways as I got ready and about to head out my mom stops me, she tells me my dad had woken up and to tell my friends that I wasn’t going to be able to go. My dad would’ve not agreed to let me go because well he’s strict. I explain to this guy that my truck was parked by the other side of the house where my parents sleep and explain to him that I didn’t want to wake them up. I also tell him that another day will be fine to talk and that it was just too late. I was about to change again when he then offers for him to pick me up. I tell him to give me a minute but really I was just so fucking shocked.  This was my first time doing something like that and even before I tell him the directions to my house he shocks me again. By sending another message saying that he was already there pulling into my street. I reply asking where because I couldn’t see his truck, I hear the engine though. His headlights were just off, I put some perfume on and head out through the back. I tell him to back up all the way to my neighbors house.  He ends up parking pretty far off because he’s sorta buzzed from drinking...yes I know. under age drinking is bad and even worse when you show up that way when a girl is trying to have a conversation and for her to express on how she felt towards you. That’s honestly rude as fuck. Whatever though, I get in his truck everything is fine we make small talk and I ask him how he knew where I lived. He said that one time he came with Friend S to pick his truck up with my dad since both Friends S’s dad and mine worked together. My dad has a trucking business so his dad often left his truck at my house. I just said “oh okay”  he then tells me he’s sorta buzzed, I tell him that I can notice. He tells me that he wants to really stop with the bad habit but that his friends keep peer pressuring him. I tell him that he can always say no and he just stays quiet then asks for what reason I smoked and I told him idk I just do and he said but why? and I said well I don’t know why can’t you stop drinking? he replied saying that it made time go faster and he wanted that because he just wants time to pass through all the shit he was going through. We talk some more and started to laugh and crack some jokes, talk a little bit of shit about our classmates in our English class. He asks what I went to do during the day I tell him and then he starts to open up to me about his problems that he’s currently facing and also on how he wanted to change and wanted something better for his family. I just listened and was being understanding. He even shared a secret that only him and two other people he had told. He said that he wanted to tell me before I found out from someone else. I’m guessing other people found out about what his secret was and what he did and it went around the school. It was a serious topic to him because everyone thought it was just a rumor but him and these other persons knew that it was actually true. I never really heard about it though, but honestly I kinda had a feeling about what that secret was. Since we live in the south, which is close to a border and you know uh I think you guys know what I’m talking about here. He then asks “I have a feeling you know what it might be” and I tell him “Well idk but let me guess what it is”. He then says okay tell me then and I tell him. I was right. He then said “How do you know? or how did you find out?” I tell him that I just had a gut feeling about it. He then told me why he had to and honestly it was an understanding reason why. He told me about what he wanted to do in the future and how he tried to just be financially stable and support his family as well. He said he was obviously not proud of what he did in the, in order to start making fast money but that he just needed to build a foundation. From there he quit doing what he did around January and stopped and instead turned to work for this other guy who has a trucking business like my dad and help him with mechanic work. He started to do that so he could keep continuing his finances. He asked me how I did it because at 17 I achieved to make 20k due to just labor work and programming computers. He was impressed with that. From this conversation we were having I was just shocked, I was seeing him as another person but I was fine with it. I liked it, he looked comfortable and being himself or maybe it was the alcohol? I guess I could say I don’t know. For me he is okay under any light because I mean I have a crush on this dude so why wouldn’t I? Plus I was just glad he was opening up to me about these multiple things he was going through and because no one else knew about most of these things. He also mentioned that he just keeps these things to himself because they’re personal. He just wanted to let me know and  also because he trusted in me that I wouldn’t be telling people. We just continue to keep talking some more then he pops the questions and says “So what was it that you wanted to talk about? I’m all ears” I’m  quiet at this point. I joke and say “well uh...just re-read the message I had sent and yeah that’s about it” He laughs and I’m sorta starting to feel regretful. Since A. I was no longer high and B.I was no longer frustrated but happy to be by him sharing a genuine conversation. As I’m trying to muster the words to even start, I let him know it’s hard for me to express my emotions. He then says he understands. I keep trying to tell him but I can’t even manage the words, my mouth was also super dry. He kept it not awkward though which I appreciated a lot and would mention something else and then would ask back “So are you gonna tell me or??” and he meant it in a funny way not demanding, but I was just overthinking on how to just say it. Even on how to start, I don’t even know how but after a while he was commenting on something about the night and I told him how I felt and he said “So you’re saying you have a crush on me?” and I just look down, nodded and when I looked up to reply he fully turns my way move towards me since we’re still in his truck he kisses me on the lips. I smile and look down then he also looks away and he just asks me since when? and for how long?and I reply and after that he doesn’t say much I guess he was shocked or i don’t know I wasn’t looking at him. I didn’t see a reaction since we just kept looking straight. He just said that he had a feeling that I kinda did  and I don’t say anything back. From there he asks “So wait since that day you started texting me you already like me?” and I reply yeah.. and he just quietly says damnn. It gets quiet then asks “wait who did you like before me? don’t tell me you liked *names friend S*” and I just said “oh hell nooo” and we look at each other and just laugh and he says “then who?” I say that I don’t remember and I actually did but I just said that because I just didn’t want to tell him that he was the first guy I made a move on or that got my first kiss from. He then says “well that’s what’s up but like why though?” and I just tell him that it’s because it was a vibe he had that attracted me and he said “ah okay, that’s what’s up” it got quiet again he turns the radio up so it won’t be awkward then asks “you like my playlist?” I laugh and nod then turns it down and starts talking about college and stuff but I was just quiet as fuck and just listened to him because I was still shocked with that kiss and didn’t expect it at all.  Especially from him because he just seemed so shy. I didn’t know what the fuck that meant or if it was just because he was buzzed.  He manages alcohol pretty well since he’s used to it and he seems like at that point the alcohol had gone down he wasn’t that buzzed. 10 mins later his mom calls he doesn’t answer her but says how he should get going. I agree but of course needing more reassurance since he didn’t really say how he felt about me back or I’m not sure if the kiss confirmed it? but I ask him about how he felt towards this and before he answered I offered him on how I didn’t want anything now, that it was obviously gonna take more time to build something and how I would like to get to know him and him to get to know me more. So I could include him in my future so we can support and be there for one another and also because I knew he had potential and drive for it. He told me he wanted that too because he wanted to go to college, become an engineer and I already knew that since we had talked about that before because I wanted to major in that as well. This time though he mentioned that he really wanted to manage a business like my dad because he admired him and his hard work. I guess you could say we sorta settled on a partnership but I’m not sure he just nodded and said he wanted the same when I told him about what we were capable of achieving together. Because we both want a good future and have the same plans since we’re attending the same college. We both come from the same backgrounds and culture and are from the same small town, you know how that shit goes. I tell him that there was no rush and how we could take our time. That I would do my thing and he would do his. He agrees and says he wants that too, I also brought up that in school I didn’t want to ignore him on purpose but because I just didn’t want people to ruin it or interfere and he said that he also wanted to say something but that he didn’t want people to get in the way. He also tells me to understand that he’s struggles to truly trust because he’s been hurt/played in the past and been fucked over before. That he just needs time to trust me even more than he already does and with time he will see that. I agree, I let him know it’s okay and tell him that I can be patient. I tell him that he can trust me since I understood the situation and how he didn’t have good luck with some girls in the past. He asks me about which girls and I said it’s okay we can leave it in the past and he says no which girls? I brought up 2 girls that I was curious about and how there were some rumors about them being with him. He tells me that one of them he was there for her because she told him that she needed a friend because she was lonely and he understood that because he knew how that felt so he was there for her. But ended up playing games because she was friends with this other who liked him too and she used that to get his attention first. That was our Sophomore year I think and then he brings up the 2nd girl who was the girl who I guess liked him first but just got to talk to him this past year in the beginning of our Senior year and how she had a a streak with him for 5 days and then he heard that she started talking around and saying that he hooked up with her but it wasn’t true. He also mentioned that when he would try to get with someone that he was just scared that they would fuck him over. That in his head it was just too good to be true and I guess self sabotage it. I understood that as well because I understand that it can be really scary. So we settle on how we were going to keep it low key like we already did and he says nods and agrees. The conversation then switches, and since he needs to get going he starts going down the dirt road he mentions on how the alcohol went down pretty quickly. I agree and reply “yeah haha” andd yeah this is where it just takes a turn....well as he gets off this dirt road on to my street I tell him to stop. He says “no let me drop you closer to your house” I say no again because my parents would hear. Since my neighborhood is pretty quiet and my parents are just used to certain noises of the trucks engines that my neighbors have. He reassures again and I say “no it’s okay, trust me” he then parks the truck in front of my neighbors house and turns the headlights off. His window is rolled down he says something like  “we had good talk” I honestly don’t remember it felt unreal still that we were together in his truck the only thing I really do remember is that my neighbors had background country music playing outside on the radio. He mentions something about it how it was weird and as he says that I turn and look at him and before I get out of the truck I literally said fuck it and went in for a cheek kiss because I felt like that first kiss maybe I seemed like I didn’t enjoy it due to my shocked face. I pull away, he then turns my way holds my face and he goes in for a full on kiss/make out? at this point I’m way too shocked and overwhelmed because that very night I was getting my first kiss and make out. He didn’t even know that it was and so I just went with the kiss. I didn’t even know what the fuck I was doing and I pulled back after what seemed like 7 seconds I believe? I pulled away and I’m like “okay okay that’s good enough haha” and smile but chuckling and he says “good enough for you but not for me” he says with a smile and I say “oh alright” I close the door behind me and go in for more. I put my hands behind his neck and we’re just over each other but he kept his hands in a safe spot around my waist but not fully hanging on just a subtle touch and just acted like I knew what I was doing pftt I clearly fucking didn’t but I just went with it. I pulled away after 10 seconds because I had an overly dry, cotton mouth and I didn’t want to over do it and it just felt unreal you know. I just say “okay that’s enough because then I won’t be able to sleep” he chuckles and after that I got off told him to not drive so fast past my house and that I’ll text him once I got back and as I closed the door we both were smiling and he said “see you tomorrow?” and I say “Um I don’t think so I’m heading out of town for an errand” “he says where?” I tell him the name of the town I was going to and he says “ah okay” I say goodnight close the door and start walking the other way towards the back of my house. He waits for about a minute but then drives away and I honestly couldn’t fucking believe it. It seemed like everything was fine and just good you know I was just super shocked and geeked. I arrive home and change and reply back on Snapchat and say “you home yet?” later I see that he posts on his story that he went back to drink with his friends and he replies “lol I went back with the boys to drink before I go home” I say “woow💀😂well becareful take care and have a goodnight🧸” the teddy bear was my signature and his was just “Goodnight, sweet dreams” but he replied with “you too” and he saved it. I mean I know that he was with his boys or whatever but what the fuck? I kinda expected like i don’t know something a little more sweeter lol but next morning I reply like the usual goodmorning how did he sleep blah blah and everything. He replies that he was hungover and asks how I woke up and I replied but then he didn’t reply back. He didn’t reply but I saw that his snap score would go up a bit. I understand though, I don’t need all that lovey dovey shit or need a shit ton of attention at all times but isn’t that weird? was it too fast for us since that was the 1st time we even hanged out in person? I genuinely felt like we had a connection or was it the alcohol buzz that made him act like that, that he impulsively went for the kiss? and that maybe he regretted it? can a guy explain that to me? anyways we’ll my mom and I went to the post office after church. At the side of the post office across the street there’s this abandoned gas station and the guys park their trucks there to hang. I saw a truck that sorta looked like his not sure if it was and had the same color head lights and it looked like they switched to the brightest one and back. I wanted to assume it was him but I wasn’t sure I never double text but I was just confused? I send him another text around 8:40 saying “are you alive?” and he replies and tells me he was sorry and that he was in Mexico like he mentioned he was going to but I forgot. I understand that you know but I would see that his snapscore would kinda go up. We texted back and forth till like 10:30? Then stopped replying and posted on his story where he was playing fortnite I was like oh okay and I went to sleep and since then he just started being distant and pulled back again like how he had before and answers like hours later. He’s consistent but then pulls back so I decided to pull back too because I respect space. but can someone please help? I’m kinda confused or maybe I’m over analyzing or overthinking? I don’t know someone please help, why do guys do that? or if a guy can answer would you do this and for what reason? I think I’m dealing with a avoidant attachment type of person here or what are your thoughts?
