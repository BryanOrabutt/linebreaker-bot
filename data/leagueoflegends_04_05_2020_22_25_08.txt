The game sounds quite complicated for new players.It is extremely difficult for players who have not played moba games before.I had no such difficulty.I am a player who has been playing for four years but I became friends with a new player I met.He could not even learn the basics of the game in fifteen days.I'm not talking about knowing the game's menus or how to play.There are many issues such as the effect of rune sequences on the game and the differences of items.There are many topics such as hero choices or which hero can be played in which role.I saw players who started the game and became 30.40 or even 100 lvl and did not know the most basic topics.It affects players who have been playing this game for years.New players cannot learn to play the game properly.Another issue is popular heroes.Considering the number of heroes in the game, for some reason I encounter yasuo in every game.This has a chain effect.For this reason, new players only start playing with yasuo.Many new players don't know what to do when I get an unpopular hero.To me, it is very boring in the game to meet the same hero constantly.New players need to be able to grasp the runes, the basic tactics of the game, or the tricks in the gameplay, and learn that different heroes are also good.Youtube videos or sites watched for this are not suitable.Many sites provide false information, and some do it on purpose.Riot should know that old players are not as important as new players.New player means new source of money to the company.Very few of the new players remain in the game.The reason for this is that the game cannot provide proper player training and the youtube channels of the sites that provide training on this issue request money.Which company does not teach how to shop from, but allows fake sites that show it and receive the money to be paid to it?I personally do not want to play with new players even though I have friends.There is a lot to learn about the game, but these are not fully taught to new players in the game.I enter the game for fun, but teaching constantly or crushing new players is not fun.Also, it is not fun to see the same heroes.Something must be done about this.
