HELP. Looking for a mans perspective. I have seen many posts on this topic but my situation is slightly different from the posts that I have seen. Let me start off by saying I am completely ok with my man watching porn, I watch it too, however I found out recently that he has been watching 5-6 times a week while also turning me down for the real deal. We have been together for a little less than 3 years and we have always had amazing sex, he used to tell me how sexy I was and how he couldn’t keep his hands off of me. Recently, he stopped saying those things and we weren’t having as much sex as we used to so I of course decided to look at his search history (I know I shouldn’t have done it but I was desperate) and I found porn all over his history. I felt so hurt/betrayed because I always am down to have sex with him, have never turned him down. So I have been keeping an eye on it the last few weeks and I’ve noticed that sometimes he’s watching it while we are under the same roof, I find that to be so hurtful. So last night I got home from work late but I was thinking about him all day long... When I got home I checked his history to see if he watched any porn and sure enough he did. I decided that I was going to thrown on a sexy bra and some tight shorts to “sleep” in... it was like he didn’t even notice or care. He just kissed me goodnight and said “Goodnight baby I love you so much but I’m so tired.” After that I decided to confront him but I didn’t tell him that I have been watching his search history. He told me that his T levels have been fluctuating and that it’s always been like that and it has nothing to do with me. But if his hormones really are fluctuating why does he still watch porn? I really don’t know what to do at this point. I love him so deeply but I’m at my breaking point and not sure what other avenues I can take to figure out what he’s thinking.
