I’m sat in tears, I just want the world to change and I know veganism is growing but I hear people say all the time that “it’s never going to change completely, we will always eat animals” and that “it’s always been like this” and to be honest I know if it was to change it would take a while but will we really be able to change the entire world. I know England is thriving right now and they’re are vegan options everywhere but look at places like japan and India, although some Indian people may not eat meat they’re the biggest producers of milk and a lot of the cows they breed for milk and veal and very malnourished and uncared for and Japanese people kill pretty much much every animal I can think of. I’ve been invited to a pig vigil with a group I’ve been with for a couple months and I just don’t think I’d be able to watch them being taken away for slaughter all for the mouths of filthy people. I want to help and I know it seems like I’m taking it all on but I want to change my dads mind so much, he has meat with almost every meal and prompts my brother to the same amounts, they’d never EVER consider veganism but will happily eat my food if me and my mum make something. I think once the penny has dropped and you know the truth behind everything and you’ve seen the footage and talked to people it really makes you see how bad things really are and how normalised slaughter and abuse is. I hate it and I just want change so fucking bad. I really need support with this because it’s making me feel so alone as I know no one in real life who is vegan other than the people in the group I’m in and I don’t really talk to them unless we’re meeting up for activism reasons. My mum says she’s basically vegan but still has milk and eggs occasionally and I used to try and ignore that but I just know what goes on and will never be able to just be okay her doing that really. I don’t know how people can like not be without it.
