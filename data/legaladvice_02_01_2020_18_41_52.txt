I've been living in my apartment for a year, this is my first apartment so the process of doing everything is a 1st I was off and on welfare and have sections 8 again been at this place for a year and some of the things they do is off to me like if rent not paid by the 1st you have to pay late fees if your late 4 times they can ask you to leave the property you can't be out side your house after the sun goes down if you bbq you can at the park and if its night time bbq,clean,and leave. How they can go in to my apartment without my permission and a year later I got my walefa up and going I tell them giving them my passport of service with other paper which was for my renewal and the paperwork they ask for. The property manager was upset that I didn't say I was getting Ebt but like I explained I was off and on and trying to get everything going and I gave her the passport to show but now she wants me to go to a store or a bank and bring a receipt showing what's on my ebt card can she do that and she threat me by saying she told housing to investing me because I didn't inform her of the welfare which I some what get if I didn't tell housing already about the whole welfare they to them.
