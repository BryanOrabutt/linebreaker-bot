So we just recently got temporary custody of my SD. Her mother has overdosed, been to jail for 3 months, continued to piss dirty for Children Services and probation. BM gets two scheduled calls a week for 15 minutes each. They are on certain days at certain times that do not change. My Fiancé Is at work during these calls, so I am left to supervise the calls. Well today my SD was on the phone with her BM, and asked to FaceTime. I had told her not today, I’d check with her dad and see if that was in the guidelines for the phone calls. I ended up texting my fiancé while they were on the phone so if they could FaceTime, BM and SD would gave the chance to do it today. Well he said he would talk to the Caseworker about it. I told the BM, that I had texted and asked about it, and that he said he would ask the caseworker in the morning. She completely ignored me. I was trying to text him and ask right that second so if they were allowed age could spend the rest of her allotted time on FaceTime. Yet me doing something to benefit BM and SD somehow translated into me being in BM business. When BM and SD got off the phone she was quick to call my fiancé. She told him “Can’t we just keep our fucking business to ourselves! She doesn’t need to be involved, telling me what I can and can’t do with SD.” She continued to get pissed because “(Me) gets to be a mother to SD, and she isn’t able to do so” My fiancé was of course quick to defend me and tell her that I’m as involved as he is, my name is on all the court paperwork as a guardian for her. I don’t understand how it’s my fault that she was on drugs and making piss poor decisions, that I happen to be living in the same household as her daughter. It’s not like I’m getting to be a mother to SD, no matter how shitty BM is, that is who will always be mom. I’ve never been spiteful when doing the phone calls or anything with the process of all of this. She was the one using and yet I’m the one to blame.
