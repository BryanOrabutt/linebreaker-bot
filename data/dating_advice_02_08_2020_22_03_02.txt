This girl i was talking to and going out with for about two months brother passed away last month and she hasn’t spoken to me since.  She said she needed a break to grief. I told her I was here for her if she needed anything or if she wanted needed someone to talk to I was here for her but i have gotten no response.  I’m not mad, I mean how can I. She is grieving and she deserves the space to do so but like idk I’m really sad.  I’m sad that she’s hurting and I’m sad that she won’t talk to me.  I just wanna know if she’s ok.  I really like her and I understand that she’s probably not in a good emotional state to date right now but regardless I hope she wants to be my friend.  I keep telling myself if she wants to talk to me she will but like I can’t help but stare at my phone thinking of all these things I wanna say but I can’t because this isn’t about me.  I need to stop being so sensitive and hurt over things that aren’t directed towards me.  Yeah I’m sad she isn’t talking to me but she had a good reason not to be.  She lost her brother and she should grieve however she need to.  I just hate this feeling I have because I actually was seeing someone I really liked and had a lot in common with and it felt like things were going to go somewhere and then everything just stopped.  Why is this so hard for me? I need to just let it go and be patient and if she wants to talk to me she will and if she never talks to me again then well I’ll just have to accept that.  I just needed to rant because I’ve literally had no one to talk to about this and I feel so stupid for feeling hurt about this.  Any advice on how i should go about this would be appreciated.  Should I keep trying to contact her or should i just let it go?  I have only messaged her twice since it’s happened and both messages were along the lines of I was still thinking of her and I was here for her.  No response from either.  Idk what to do I’m just so sad about all of it.
