To put into perspective I'm 23 and my girlfriend/fiance is 22. We've been together for 3 years. And she's the only one I've ever slept with. For what I feel we have had a healthy relationship. There's always been trust and communication. Honestly pretty happy. I do a majority of the house work. Like dishes, laundry, cleaning, etc.  And she does the cooking and taking care of our pets for the most part. And honestly i don't mind that. I need to have things done a certain way and my dad always taught me to not let the women do the cleaning. But lately she wants work on herself because she thinks she doesn't bring value to our relationship. She sees me doing all the work and she feels like she's being lazy and unfair. I mean idc really I enjoy it but I also understand where she's coming from. She's gonna get her own place soon to help work on herself and not have a lot of distractions. Which I'm also okay with. Its not a breakup but more like a distance relationship even though we are still 10 minutes away from each other. Along with her saying she wants to work on her,, she said that I should go out and explore. Rather it be traveling, talking to new people, or sexually. She is the one I lost my virginity to and been the only one for 3 years. Which I'm okay with. But she wants me to go out and have fun because I didn't get that "ho life." I've been taught to only have sex with the person I love. And I still believe that. I have a very high sex drive and she has a very low one. I never pressure her into having sex its more of if it happens it happens. Idk why she thinks I should sleep around. She's also said that she would be my wingman and help. And if for some reason I think I found "my soulmate" while doing this then she would be happy for me. Idk sorry if I left anything out I'm still trying to process all of this myself. Any question I will answer. And any advice is appreciated. Thank you.
