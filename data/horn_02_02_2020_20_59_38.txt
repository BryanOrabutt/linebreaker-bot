So i really don't know what to do. I'm currently in high school and I stopped playing horn for a year.  used to be really good, in terms of my intonation,etc.. I understand I don't sound the same due to my not playing for a year but the thing is... I used to wear braces and I also didn't wear my retainers for a long long, long time. When I learned Horn and the majority of when I fixed my tone and learned notes was with braces and my previous teeth position. Now, I am just way off because my teeth shifted and there's nothing I can do about it. I wear my retainers now constantly everyday and yes my teeth slightly got better but even when playing horn my two front teeth touch my lips while I play and it's difficult to get the right tone out, alone playing notes. i auditioned for honor band two weeks ago and the only reason why I'm in is because my previous band director and my current band director vouched for me because im good and both understood that I'm struggling playing.. but we have a guest conductor who is really harsh and would notice my tone or if i don't play. in one practice with my regular band, i played with my retainers and my tone was perfect, but i cant tongue so that option is out. how can i adjust myself to play better? i hear the note i want to play with my head... but my teeth and lips do not work well together and i have been really slow with myself in learning for two weeks whenever i could everyday for 2 hours (i have school). im just really sad and i cant stop crying at this point because im pushed by time and im sad because my first honor band rehearsal is in 1 and a half days. The music isn't difficult, with practice. But since i am not doing well to even play a note itself it's so hard. theres so many 16th notes, and tonguing, and my intonation and skill isnt there. Any advice and help would be appreciated, im so desperate and I can't focus on anything else. Thank you!
