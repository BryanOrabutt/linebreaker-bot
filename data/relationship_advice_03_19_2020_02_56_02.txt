Here’s the thing. I have had a crush on someone from my school for the past month. I have a crush on someone who I have never spoken to before or had a class with. I really really really want to dm him because that is so far my only way of trying to start talking to him due to me only seeing him when I have VERY limited time to get to class (our school has strict policies for tardies such as a tardy equaling one d-Hall) & the coronavirus. I won’t be able to go back to school for about another month. But, I can’t stop thinking about this guy. I tried to follow him, but he didn’t follow me back. He only looks at my insta story when I view his story & like his posts. The only times when he has looked at my story without him posting something was when I temporarily had a profile picture of my cat and another time. But, I think that the reasons why he did not follow me back is because he does not know that I go to his school and does not know me. I just can’t stop thinking about this guy. I really want to make a move on him. But, I want to do it the right way. I hate that I am now developing a crush on him when I have two months left until we graduate and with us losing a month of school. I also can’t stand seeing him following all of these girls that is going to his college and him hanging out with people he probably never thought that he would hang out with a year ago. I just feel like the longer I wait. The less time I have to put myself out there before he becomes taken. I really feel like he could potentially meet the one and I feel like he is one of those guys that a lot of girls become really attracted to (he is pretty popular now). But, I feel like we might have some things in common and he could be a potential for me. Also, I don’t want to come off as creepy or make it obvious that I have a crush on him when I do dm him. What do I do? What do I say? This crush is really driving me crazy.
