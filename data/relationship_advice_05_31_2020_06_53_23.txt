23 gay m here who has been best friends with a 23 f for about 7 years. However, I’ve known her and her family for much longer. My friend f has a younger brother whom I’ve known since he was in middle school. He’s now about to turn 20. He’s straight as far as I know. I’ve hung out with him in family and private gatherings and nothing has ever happened. No flirting or anything. Just yesterday I stopped by to pick up my friend to go to a party but she was still getting dressed so I waited in the kitchen with her brother. He was telling me that for his 21st birthday his cousins were going to take him to a strip club and he wanted to get a lap dance. He also mentioned that he’d been working out a lot because he wanted to impress a girl. I said that I noticed he had put on some muscle and jokingly said “ you’re looking good”. Mind you, we’ve never flirted in any way and by no means did I mean this in a flirting way. I just wanted to boost his confidence. My friend was ready so she and I took off and I said goodbye to her brother. After being at the party for about 30 min, I get a snap from my friend’s brother asking if I’m with his sister. I wasn’t so I told him no. Then he sends me a snap and it’s of his hard cock. I was speechless. I didn’t know what to respond so I asked what was that for. He said he wanted me to rate his cock and I said I wouldn’t. I asked him if he was gay or bi and he said no. I dont know what to do now because I spend a lot of time with my friend and her family and this is going to make things incredibly awkward. He’s clearly confused and needs to talk to someone but I’m sure he wouldn’t want to talk to his family and im not going to out him. I would talk to him myself but I feel like he may take it the wrong way and try to make another move. Any advice is appreciated.
