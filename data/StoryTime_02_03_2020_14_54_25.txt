So I was playing with my group and my character being a Mafia Boss decides to start recruiting people in the sewer and he recruits three homeless people and manages to get the attention of the biggest crime Lord in the city keep in mind you this is the city from Magic Gathering so yeah I caught the attention of gonti naturally my character not having any of his weapons decides to start talking his mouth off and this is how another person is introduced to the campaign we have an artificer that has a that is working on the fixing the fights for the mafia what flights do I ask the contract fights and the construct fights oh yeah did I mention our group also attacked the constructs that were that were just walking towards the edge of the stadium and the group that initiated it well I guess with us but but I digress these two players individual Lee were new players and they had not read the phb a day in their life one of them was playing as Chara and the other was playing as just some random elf by the way if you're wondering what race my character is he is a high elf and he drinks beer I don't know why I included that but we fought a construct and their dad was a security guard at it and he stabbed it with his jevil and the DM not wanting to slaughter his players at first level decided to not murderous and have it just shut down and now the last session we found the constructed because the had an opinion and it has a fever color as well and some other artificers were like hey it'd be nice to have wheels and then they stole it from gonti which is not the smartest thing to do also knocked out my character also not the smartest thing to do I grabbed my three homeless people in my Mafia that I had recruited which I'm paying with food at that moment so he decides to go to goonti so we went door-to-door trying to find who stole the head and also the artificer it was a very funny session please comment if you have similar stories
