Okay, I am extremely drunk so that's why I even have the guts to post to this subreddit that I have been a part of since right before I turn to 20, and I'm using voice text. But I want you all to know that it's going to be okay, that you guys can make it, that high school isn't it and I'm sure the 18 and 19 year olds have kind of realized that already, but first f***** sake I dropped out at 16, and I worked a s*** ton different jobs to pay bills and I had no reason to dropouts other than I didn't like school I went through depression and the likes I lost probably the second biggest male role model in my life in my great-grandfather, but no matter how low you sink and I'm talking abou someone who has veen homeless there is still hope you will still have people there for you regardless of it's in real life or not, and I mean I was homeless and I worked dead-end jobs and I managed to get a good gig at a warehouse and work my way up and now I'm kind of finally happy after everything and I know what it's like to be a teenager and to not have hope and to be in a s*** place, I've been there I've lived on the streets I've wondered where my next meal will come from, but now I'm on the track doing what I want to do in my life. And regardless of where you are in you are teenage years things will get better don't lose hope. Believe in yourself and don't lose sight of what you want to do because no matter what happens and you get knocked off your path that you want to follow you can still follow it no matter what it may be harder but if you truly want it you will follow it. So take it from me, I've been homeless I've been jobless, I've wondered where my next meal will come from, I've seen lots of things that people don't want to see. But I stuck through it and things are getting better. You we'll make it through this just don't lose hope.
