This guy named “RobDHunter” added me on snapchat a long time ago & I wasn’t sure how he knew me but then recently started swiping up on my stories saying that my wax was booty & that he had the best shit in the city blah blah blah so I went to pick up from him & as I was opening the wax he forcefully told me to put it away and to come out to the living room and take a dab, that it was on him. He was very persistent so I took one and it was pretty good so I thought not much of it, and I was about to head out and he started to say something and said the N word 2-3 times and I was like woah man I really don’t feel comfortable with you saying that please stop & he began to get super loud & angry and was yelling about how he has been to prison and whatever, so I just dipped as soon as possible. When I got home I tried to take a dab and first of all I couldn’t even get any smoke into my lungs before I started bursting out into a raging coughing fit (I have been smoking THC for over 5+ years & it has never once affected me the horrible & nasty way this did) It felt like my lungs were closing. The smoke tasted like peppermint and was so moist going down. I don’t want to hear any comments about “you deserve it because you smoke” or “just buy it legally” I have legitimate reasons for smoking & do not deserve to be fucking poisoned because I do. Anyways after I called him out on it on snap he said that he would make it up to me either giving me a good gram of wax or sending me my money back.... He then proceeded to put me in a very uncomfortable situation by asking me to come over alone & said that he wanted me to come “make him feel better” knowing that i have a boyfriend, I tried to decline in the nicest way possible. Well, when I asked him to legitimize his part of the deal he decided to start calling me crazy, becoming rude & defensive. So in conclusion, he can go to hell.
