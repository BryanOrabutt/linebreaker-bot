 I'm kind of looking for advice here. To recap I've known this guy for about 7 months when we first met I was 17 and I visited his house with a friend of mine and her bf to chill (bc I was nervous abt meeting a stranger basically) I was drunk as fuck we did nothing but there was a lot of flirting and instigating from him which I denied bc we'd just met) We hit it off really well I felt a connection with him like i'd never had before, he knew my age n I was worried abt starting a sexual relationship (it was 5 months before I turned 18) We kept meeting n I told him there would be no sex before I turned 18 but he was increasingly persistent although we never did and he mostly respected my boundries I felt uncomfortable at times bc he was throwing so much love and affection at me at the same time, we kept a "thing" is the best way I can describe it up until I turned 18 n then we fucked.. since then we've been together (I'm not telling most ppl bc it's not worth the shit i'll get) I've explained to him I'm still finding who I am and It's not a serious realtionship bc it's a big jump to settle with someone more than double my age..most of the time we're good but he's very obsessive with me, overly affectionate, and buys/offers me money constantly, Coming from a poor background this feels strange to me n I decline but he persists that I accept them,,which I end up doing to not feel rude. Any mention of other guys he'll become very passive aggressive even if I've explained that we're good friends, blows up my phone 24/7 which is all good but I'm not used to this kind of "love" I have doubts. The doubts started when a few months ago he told me I couldn't wear a certain type skirt bc it's too revealing,I lost my shit n told him he has no right to tell me what I can wear etc and wanted a break when he still insisted I can't during this break shit went sour, he started banging on windows of buses I was on, sending me hundreds of abusive messages (worthless fucking whore for example) despite this I took him back ..it feels like love. or I'm an idiot ,, thoughts? please tell me i'm a fucking idiot.
