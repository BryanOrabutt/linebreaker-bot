Something bizarre happened to me and my cousin a few days ago. It was Tuesday 11 p.m. and I and my cousin were talking on Snapchat and it was a normal conversation as always but then something strange happened my cousin send me a video and in that video, you could see her and a window behind her and she said do you see what I see? at first I did not notice anything but then when she took the video again and zoomed in on the window i saw something that looked like a small alien and it was just standing there and looking in to the camera and when i saw that i just felt really weird and i got chills all over my body my cousin also got scared she even started to cry later and I asked her why are you still sitting there and then the situition got even more weirder she said that she could only see it on camera when she was looking at the window behind her there was nothing there it was only on camera so she thought that maybe there were just something with the camera like a glitch or something but it did not looked like a glitch it literlly looked like a small alien then she tried to take a video of it again for the 3 time but it was already gone and because something like that never happened to us we were really confused and we were just trying to figure it out what that would might be and because of that we forgot to save the video so we could have a proof and i know is hard to believe without any proof so the next day she tried to take a video of it again at the same time but there were just nothing there and i know for 100% that it wasn't some kind of prank or something because she never does any pranks on me and we don't even talk about aliens or any paranormal things. It's been a couple of days since that happened and nothing happened since then but we still think about it a lot if it was some kind of alien or something and we just want to hear what you guys think it might have been and if something similar like this happened to you also?
