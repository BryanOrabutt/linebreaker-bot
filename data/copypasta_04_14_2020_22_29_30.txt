I am playing PlayStation and eating chips, but the chips get to my ass so I decide to take a shit in the bathroom and then clean it with a toilet brush and then brush my teeth with said toilet brush and then realize how gross that tastes so I wash my mouth with mouthwash except the mouthwash is the toilet water, still contaminated with poop, so it does not really help, so I get a hose and clean my mouth but the hose is a snake and it bites me in the chin and I get a disease from it and I go to the hospital and seek help quickly for my snake bite but it’s hard to talk because my mouth still tastes very gross so I leave the hospital and go to ikea and eat lunch there except I didn’t go to ikea, I went to the local garbage dump and ate a burnt coke can which despite being not very tasty was still an improvement, so now, fresh and ready, I head back to the hospital, but due to the covid-19 outbreak I cannot get a spot, so I wait in the waiting room whilst watching Dora on the TV, which reminds me that I never wiped my ass, so I rush back home but the door is locked because my wife is tired of me so I go to the local paper company and steal from them by breaking in through their window, however, in the process of climbing through said window, a glass shard gets jammed up my urethra which puts me in excruciating pain, so I scream and this gives away my cover, and I am pushed out of the window, and land on the ground, cracking my tailbone, and I try to go back to the hospital but I cannot walk, and also I still have yet to wipe my butt, so I use my hand but now I must wash my hand, of course, so I go to the local pool and dunk my hand in, but someone sees me and screams and I am taken into custody by the town police and arrested for public fecal matter disposition and am locked up for 8 months, but I still cannot move so I go to the infirmary within the prison but in my slow motion, a criminal sees me and kicks me in the butt, and paired with my broken tailbone, extremely hurts, and I still have a bad taste in my mouth, so I eat his shoe, which somehow angers him, and he throws me at the wall, which hurts, and I cry, and drink my tears because I am thirsty, and I realize I am thirsty because the snake bite has infected me with a severe infectious disease, which has infected the criminal who harassed me, which for some reason angers him, so he beats me up and kills me, except I don’t die, I stay alive to suffer, and I reach for the knife to finish the job but I cannot reach, and then I soil myself, and cannot wipe because I am immobile, so I remain suffering on the ground, dying slowly of the infectious disease from the snake, and also the severe wounds from the beating, so I am rendered incapable of doing anything and sent to the infirmary where my disease has gone too far to reverse the effects and so they pull my plug. This is why Xbox is better than PlayStation.
