So first just let me say I love my husband desperately. He's an amazing husband and father. He's loving and attentive and we've been through alot together. Anyway, my husband has trouble with feminine feelings. I'm not just talking about liking fashion or enjoying a good chick flick I'm talking full on wishing he was a woman. He goes back and forth and is terribly torn. He has had these feelings since he was a child and has lost two marriages because of it. The problem is I didn't understand the extent until after we were married. There was even a point where he wore woman's clothes and called himself Amber and I supported her. I told her that I loved her, that I couldn't be married to her because I'm not attracted to women ect. I helped her get the hormones she wanted and the clothes she wanted and never once made her feel bad about any of it. I suffered greatly because I was losing my husband but I never let on how bad it hurt me. However shortly afterwards.. a few weeks. She had a mental break and was taken to a phycologist crisis center. After she was released she swore she wanted to be a man and a husband and a father and that I needed to forgive him and he'd prove he could be the man I needed. I told him it was unhealthy to try to be something he's not and that his past relationships indicated that it wouldn't just "go away." He insisted and I gave in because I love him deeply. Now it's been about a month and he's gone above and beyond and I feel like I have my husband back...the trouble is I feel incredibly guilty. I know he struggles with this and I know he still wants to wear the woman's clothes but he says he can't live without me. He has a therapist and is seeking help but what happens when this all falls apart? What happens if he stays away from it and then gets insanely depressed or we get 10 years down the line only for him to change his mind again? I promised I'd give him the benefit of the doubt but at what cost to him...and me? What should I do?
