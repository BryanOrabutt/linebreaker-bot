Three years ago when I met my now husband he was making 70K a year, now he makes over 200k. I came into this relationship with no debt, and savings. He had maxed out credit cards with no savings. For the past couple years of him making this higher income he has paid off his credit cards to then max them out again, and has saved nothing. After having our first baby last summer I took hold of our finances. I paid off one credit card and have a payment plan to pay off the rest within a year. I also took 5k and squirreled it away in a one-year CD just so we had something he couldn't touch. He recently read Rich Dad Poor Dad and can now see he was been quite horrible with money. He want s to invest in the real estate market. I have a plan to have 30k by January of 2021 for a home. But we aren't sure what path to take. My husband wants is liking the idea of BRRR, while I just want to get out of the rental we currently in, and then save again and invest the following year. We are currently paying $3,000 a month (we live in the Seattle area), and I see this as such a waste of income. He thinks  if we buy and move into a home we won't be able to then invest in other properties and turn them into rentals. There are so many books, and so much information out there on real estate investing, and we are currently reading as much as we can. But I am wondering if anyone could offer some advice on our personal situation. I should also add we have not started any retirement accounts, emergency savings (minus the 5k I put in a CD), and we have yet to start a college fund for our kid. Would we be ignorant to throw all our money into rental properties while also being renters ourselves? Should we create a safety net first, buy our own home and then look at investment properties? With the expenses we have now, we have the potential to save 50k a year. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!
