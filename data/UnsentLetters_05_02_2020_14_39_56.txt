I hate how things ended up between us. The trust is gone. I don’t know if we can ever repair what’s been done. There has been no cheating, but the lies have just messed everything up on both ends. We can keep trying to be friends, but it never works because of the feelings that are there. This has become so toxic that it’s just not healthy at all anymore. We have this hike planned in Colorado next week and I am not sure if I can go through with it without bringing up bullshit. Then you will snap. Then we will argue. Then it will be a long trip back to Texas. I’m just worried that this may be the last time I spend any time with you. At the same time, I feel like it’s best that we end whatever this is on a good, fun note. At least we will have this memory of us as the last. If I can just hold my tongue and not let anything negative thoughts consume me during this trip, then we will be ok. I want you back so much but I don’t believe that I am equipped to be what you need. To be the one that can handle the severe depression and what comes with that. I am so sorry that I can’t be the support you need. You’ve said that it’s the issue before, but I will continue to deny it until the end. I just never want to make you feel bad about something you can’t control. I feel bad when we stop talking. I feel bad after another “break up”, and that’s the reason I keep letting you pull me back. I cannot do this anymore and I am so fucking sorry. As I’m typing this, I can honestly say that I love you and this hurts so much that I have tears in my eyes. I just want things to be like they were when they first started.. but that’s impossible. I realize now while writing that I will have to do my absolute best to not start anything about the past. I will be living in that moment and that moment only. I love you and I’m sorry that after this week we won’t see each other anymore. I love you. I love you. I really do love you. I’m so sorry.
