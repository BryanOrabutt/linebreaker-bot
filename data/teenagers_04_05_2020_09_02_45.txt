The name of this post may catch your attention, I made it that way on purpose. As I was cursing the internet at 3:30 AM, I decided to check on some of my personal favorite YouTube Heros. The people I'm talking about made 2008-2014 livable on the Internet. I'm talking about people like Seannaners, CaptainSparkles, AllShamNoWow, GassyMexican, MrSark, ChilledChaos, and many others who are smaller-time channels, or ones I am embarrassed to mention due to their channel now. I am saddened to say, that the people who expanded the platform and made it accessible for so many to create careers that spark joy in the lives of others; then there's ALi A. Seananners, also known as Adam Montoya, started a gaming channel with regular appearances of several former YouTube Stars, like RpgMinx, Pewdiepie (still alive), CinnamonToastKen, and many others. He sadly disappeared from in 2018, with regular appearances on other channels. GassyMexican, he was funny, sarcastic, and was all round a cool guy, he has now lowered his video publishing to 2-3 times a week, instead of his former 6-8 per week. MrSark still uploads, one of the few that do regularly, and he makes entertaining videos. Sham had disappeared from my interests, losing the special chemistry he had with other content creators. ChilledChaos has recently posted a video saying he was working on his channel personally, while not being a bad thing, how many YouTube Heros have suddenly stopped posting due to self reflection or personal problems, never to post again? Sadly, we are at an end of an age in YouTube, instead of seeing a majority of gaming content where people are having fun, we are now seeing a template change to reactions, and podcast like videos of people talking about topics like Subreddits, Vines, TikToks, and other social platforms swarmed with memes. I dare say we have left the Golden Age of YouTube. With many (not all) older content creators disappearing, or moving on from YouTube, we have entered a recession we will not exit any time soon. We have to appreciate the ones we still have left, and the imprint they have had on our lives. I will humbly ask you too comment unmentioned YouTube Heros that made life bearable, and I ask you too venture onto YouTube some time soon, and visit some old friends. Now here I sit, in my living room, writing this paragraph of text that means almost nothing to the internet. I will only make a few happy, I care about your history with the internet, and her glorious people that made life interesting. If you feel like it, along with the comment of your favorite YouTube Hero, add why, and think deeply upon your answer, because they may one day leave YouTube, and join their fallen content creators. I will now ask my leave, for the internet is calling, and I shall not refuse her request.
