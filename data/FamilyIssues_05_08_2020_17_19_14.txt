Okay so I’m divorced and I have 3 kids, my ex and I are doing shared custody so my kids come see me 3 days a week. My almost 14 y/o son says terrible and hurtful stuff eveytime he comes over, he says that his dad and step mother say I’m crazy and some other rude stuff, at first I used to get upset and tell my son things about his dad, but then I realized that it’s wrong to say this and I should be a good role model to my son, so I decided to become the bigger one, eveytime my son comes over and says the hurtful stuff I tell him it’s ok your dad says these things because maybe he’s hurt or something, they’re good people and blah blah.. when I say that my son gets mad and says stop trying to act innocent and try to be a good person because you’re not. Last weekend when he came over he said very hurtful stuff, and I was devastated and hurt because out of all my kids I loved him the most, and I always got things for him, he actually always asks me to buy things for him and he never asks his dad because he know that his dad will never get them for him.. so anyways, last time he said hurtful things again I was so upset and I got mad at him and I told him I don’t want him in my life and that he’s evil and he’s a hypocrite because he’s double faced he always says things about me to his dad and things about his dad to me. I just feel so bad that I told him these things because I feel like he’s going through abandonment issues given the fact that I left the house when we got divorced.. I don’t know what to do because my other two younger kids are good and they’re kids so they don’t understand the situation as much as my older one does.. but I’m really hurt because of the things his dad and his stepmom tell him about me and when I try to justify to him he doesn’t believe me and he becomes disrespectful!!? I don’t know how to deal with this situation..
