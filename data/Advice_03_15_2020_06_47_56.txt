Ok so I have this friend who I met about 5 years ago through social media. Let me start first by describing our friendship. I’d say we’re fairly close friends to be honest. We’ve been through a lot of shit. At first when we started talking, we got in to arguments over the stupidest reasons, we don’t argue anymore as we learned to get past it and matured. She tells me anything because she trusts me. She even would tell me how much she admires, appreciates and love me. We used to text each other paragraph after graphs exposing how we feel and occasionally we have deep intellectual conversations which I we both enjoy. We would stay up and text or call each other almost every other night and talk about anything. We’re a bit older now and don’t talk as much because ya know... responsibilities. But that’s life and I still consider her a close friend and I’m glad I met her. I’d say we’re pretty much the same in terms of common interests. The crazy part is that our birthdays are in the same month!! Our birthdays are in April, but mine comes a day before hers. Mine is the 26th and hers is the 27th. Coincidence? Maybe...sometimes I like to think we were meant to cross paths and she says the same thing too. Also we both been wanting to see each other in person in a few years, but I’m not sure how I would tell my parents about her. Yeah they don’t know her and I’m worried if I do tell them about her and say that I want to meet her, they’ll say no. Even if they do meet her and get to know her,I still think they’ll hesitate. My parents are kinda protective over me when it comes to people they don’t know. I know they care about my safety and all, but still I feel like they should allow me to travel and my parents have become a bit more lenient towards me and what I hat I do outside the house. Back then, they were kinda strict. But anyways, do you guys have any advice on how I should handle this? And side note I’m 20 living with parents sigh
