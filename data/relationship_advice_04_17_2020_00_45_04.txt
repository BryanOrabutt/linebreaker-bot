We are both college students [21f] [23m]. I know that we are free to talk to whoever we want in college because sometimes we need to help each other out with homework or anything else related to class. However, I was not aware of this girl at the beginning of the relationship until I saw her texting my boyfriend 3 months later. I would see him hide his phone constantly and it made me feel uneasy because I thought it was suspicious through those 3 months. Anyways, I explained I felt uncomfortable knowing that there was a female classmate he was perhaps close with because she was talking about personal problems through text message. I explained how that made me feel uncomfortable because I never knew about this ‘classmate’ until way later.  Meanwhile, I would be an open book explaining how group projects were going and talking about my inner circle and acquaintances. I always refrain from texting other male classmates because I wouldn’t want to create misunderstandings if I texted them about personal problems. His reason for not saying anything, was because she was just a classmate and that they didn’t talk about anything but class. 2 months later, she happened to walk up to us on campus and I was introduced to her. She didn’t seem thrilled by the introduction at all as I found her to be a bit hypocritical. Then the couple of minutes we were sitting, she somewhat leaned over to see what he was doing and kept smiling. I was very confused. After the meeting, I let my boyfriend know that I didn’t like how the intro went. I was soon told I was jealous, insecure, and dramatic. I let it go and thought, “Maybe I am. I’ll come clean about feeling anxious about the situation.” We ignored that and continued on. A month later, his phone happened to be on and I saw a thread of messages they exchanged. What made me upset was that he said he cut off all contact because I felt uncomfortable, but behind my back he was still texting her. Lately, he likes her posts on social media after he said days before “I cut off all contact.” So now, we are back at him saying it doesn’t matter that he’s liking her posts and that it doesn’t mean anything. He also says I don’t trust him at all and that I think the worst of him. He knew I had trust issues, I’ve explained my discomfort every time, he tells me to not worry, and I tell him that my boundary was that issue. If the intro would’ve gone better and he would’ve been more transparent throughout, I would completely understand. I also have told him several times. However, he continues to say I’m not understanding at all. Almost makes me feel like he’s saying, “even though she makes you uncomfortable I’ll still have some kind of contact because I cannot just stop talking to her. You have to accept that or I’m done with the relationship.” We’ve been dating for 7 months now. My friends keep saying that I should end it now because the situation is never gonna change. In previous reddit posts people have said that I’m plain insecure and that I should be more mature 🤣 Help 🙃
