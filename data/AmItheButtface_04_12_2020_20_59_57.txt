 I am a college freshman majoring in math. Back in my sophomore year of high school, I took the AP Calculus BC exam and got a 5 with no tutoring, cheating, help, etc. I was completely on my own just working hard. My sister got a 4 on her AB test last year as a sophomore, and is now taking the BC exam as a junior. Due to COVID-19, AP exams, rather than being carefully proctored in person, are now obviously online. My sister's class is small, and I took my class with many of her classmates' sibling. We are currently about a month out from the exam, and my parents (effectively) demanded that I help (i.e. effectively take the exam for her) without any immediate mention of compensation. Their argument is that my sister's classmates' siblings are certainly going to help them as well, and that my sister is deserving of my help due to her 'hard work' throughout the year and the 'circumstances' of the test. My argument goes in 2 directions: since we are a month out from the exam, there is absolutely nothing stopping my sister from working hard the same way I did and getting a 5 on her own. However, if I do help her, I think that I am only deserving of significant financial compensation, given that not only is she a year older than me when I took the exam, but she also received tutoring services throughout the year for the class when I never received the same. My mom in particular is disgusted by the fact that I would ask to be payed to help (take) the exam for my sister. To this, I respond that there is no way that the siblings of her classmates are not ALSO being compensated for their help. If my sister learns that I will be helping her on the exam, there is no way that she will put in any effort to study for the exam, knowing that my help will all but guarantee her a perfect score anyway, meaning that I would have to put in even more effort on her behalf (and, in my opinion, be entitled to even more financial compensation). AITA for this argument?
