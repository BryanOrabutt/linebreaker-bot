I got tired of pulling away. I got tired of walls. I got tired of blocking people out in case you ever decided to step forward. I decided to stop living in my fantasy world today and I got everything I wanted and needed from today. I plan to do the same tomorrow. I need something now. I’ve finally come to terms that it’ll never be what I want to be, I just fill a small void for you, I don’t truly matter to you, so I acted on that realization but I do still want to close it out properly for me, I hope you’re still giving me that. Everything I’ve ever said to you was true. I had no reason to lie. Sometimes I wonder how much you knew, how much you read, how much of my past that I tried to share with you that you actually picked up on. A part of me feels like I did mean something. I wonder if you ever wrote me something here. I have no idea. I never read these things as if something is for me because the odds are slim and it’ll make you crazy. If there was ever anything you’ve left out and didn’t say to me, or something you did share that I never noticed, please share. I’ve already said everything I’ve ever had to say. There are two instances that made me realize that you were here. I don’t know for how long or anything but that you’ve read some of my stuff. You didn’t run. You accept me just as I am. For that I am thankful. It’s deeply appreciated that  I can take all my masks off and be me. There were a few things that I felt could have been written for me, but I just treated them as they weren’t because they probably weren’t. If you’d rather talk, hit me with a good morning text and we can sort it out otherwise we will walk when we close this out. I’m not upset or angry. I think I can understand it all. Maybe not fully, but I think I figured the big picture of everything and what can I do other than live with it and move on? Anyway, I hope I get a good morning text. If not, I’ll assume that closure is off the table. Either way I’ll always be fond of you.
