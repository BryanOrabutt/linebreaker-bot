Hi, so my mother is going through a bit of a rough time right now. My grandpa (her father, 87) is in his last stage of cancer and he's getting worse by the day. We knew that he didn't have long but it still makes us sad. My mom is currently with my grandparents in the village where they live in, along with my uncles, and has been living temporarily with them for about two months or so. She's obviously very upset about her father being so sick and it's even worse because no one in my near family has died and the situation, even though inevitable, is also new to everyone. Other than making sure she knows that my dad, sister and I are doing fine, I don't know what else to do to help in the situation. I was planning on getting a job in the summer so that I can have an income of my own and be a little more independent and responsible. Also, if I don't get a job, my parents will make me go for the whole summer with them to my father's beach house which is right next to my other grandparents' house. I won't go into detail about this since it's off topic but I completely despise it there for a ton of reasons and have been looking for an excuse for me not to go. I've told them that I don't like it there but they don't care. I need a job but I also want to be there for my mum. I don't know if I'll be able to look for one by my own but I'm sure my friends will help me. These are hard times for both my parents but I also don't want to do one of the very little things that make me completely uncomfortable. So, should I still look for a job for the summer and not leave the city I live in? I really want to and have been planning this for a couple of years, so it's hard for me to make such decision. I'm not really that upset about my grandpa (I know I sound mean) and I will be a bit sad but that won't hold me back from getting a job. I really don't know what I should do....
