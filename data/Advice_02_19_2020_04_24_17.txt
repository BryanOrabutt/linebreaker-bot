I don’t need to be kissed up to. On the nice scale I am and this isn’t missing my own ass 11/10. I try hard at work. I’m nice to everyone. If someone needed my help I’d be there ASAP. My supervisor helped me pick out some new office supplies for my desk which I sad I was going to get. The day it came I asked her if it would be weird to bring it all at once. Her reply? You’re on probation you’re new you can’t bring anything. I know the contract I signed. I spent $400ish on stuff for my desk. I wasn’t going to wait half a year when every other employee said they never heard of that. I asked our boss who said feel free to decorate. I told my supervisor please don’t think I went over her head I respect her opinion but I was hoping since I spent quite a bit she’d not care. I was originally told to decorate my space anyway so I was confused. She said I’m overthinking it wasn’t that deep. Ok. So next day I’m moved to a broken desk area. She’s openly rude to me. I almost cry lol. She humiliated me the day before actually by saying a girl emailed her saying I was asking her questions and she was busy and she called me up in front of everyone and said to leave her alone. I explained the girl asked for help and I messaged her 4x. She’s like that’s now what she said. Today I thought she said she’d clock me in because I was unable to as I was switching computers and desks. I heard wrong, okay. But she was like HAVE I EVER CLOCKED YOU IN?! DO I EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT? Gave me a dirty look and rolled her eyes. Her bestfriend and another Birkat messaged me to not take stuff personally and all this stuff. How could I not? I’ll admit I want to be liked. I want to make people happy, and help. I do want work friends but I’ll settle for just working and not being picked on. How do I deal with this? Especially coming from a supervisor who’s my age?
