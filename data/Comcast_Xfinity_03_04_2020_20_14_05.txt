As a non customer I can now see why Comcast customers complain so much.  We've been in our newly built house for 1 year and when we noticed some exposed wires in the corner we called 811, that was 2-weeks ago.  Everyone came out the next day (Centerpoint gas, Centerpoint electricity, ATT and someone was nice enough to label and circle the wires and identify them as belonging to Comcast.  My first call to Comcast was hell because it appears that they only have one 800 number and if you're not a customer with an account it takes close to 10 minutes to weave through their automated system and if you don't press any buttons it takes longer to speak with an agent.  My first call was reported on 2/24 @ 10:55a gave the rep. our address and was told someone would call to schedule an appt.  At 11:21am same day, received a call from someone who needed more information about the address in order to get someone out today, but he didn't leave his name or direct number.....HE CLOSED THE TICKET.   Called back (same day) @ 11:50 to have a new ticket created.  The next day after not hearing from anyone, I called back to get a status update.  THE 2ND TICKET WAS CLOSED. So I opened another ticket on  2/25 (this makes 3 tickets) to have someone come and take care of these cables.  I mean what do we have to do?  Waive a truck down in the street?  If anyone can offer an advice on how to get Comcast to take care of their equipment I'd greatly appreciate it.  There is no restricted access so all they have to do is call first and they should be finished with the job in less than 5 minutes.  I would put this in writing on their website but they don't have a customer service email listed.  I'm tired of calling and I don't want to chat.  So, if anyone has a customer service email address that would help as well.  I'm about to take matters into my own hands if they don't want to do their jobs.
