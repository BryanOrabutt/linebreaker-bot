My intention in posting this isn’t to brag so I really hope it doesn’t come off that way 🥺 In high school, I became super depressed and let my grades slip during junior year. I didn’t even show up to half of senior year and I was rejected by nearly every UC/school I applied to. I knew this was going to happen but I felt like a failure and that I wasn’t living up to the true potential I had. I remember sitting on a curb with one of my teacher’s telling him I *did* get into a college and he looked me in the eye, paused and said “I didn’t even think you were going to graduate high school”. In some ways, his surprise was warranted because I’m not sure myself how I graduated. But at the time it made me think- “wow, so everyone else thinks I’m a failure too”. I ended up going to community college and along the way discovered what it was that I truly wanted to study and made new friends+massive improvements to my mental health (although sprinkled with some emotional turmoil over feeling left behind/being stuck at home). I’ve now gotten into every single UC I applied to (didn’t apply to Cal because not the right fit for me :() and it’s kind of bewildering to think that two years ago I was opening my decisions as jokes because I “knew” I was dumb, stupid, worthless (<my internal monologue then). This time I was opening them with a bit of anticipation but also with acceptance that whatever happens happens and I will be okay wherever I end up because I am capable. And that this in no way determines my worth. When the fuck did this mindset change happen?? There’s no single moment I can point to because it was a long-ass, maybe sometimes painful journey to get here. But you don’t need to follow this path that’s been ingrained into us since we were little kids to have a good life. Imagine how boring the world would be if we all walked on the exact same road?? At the exact same time?? It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. I know this all seems kind of wishy washy but I promise you’re going to be okay. Maybe it won’t be okay allll the time but that’s life you know? It’ll just get to a point where you’re okay more often than not. It’ll be okay.
