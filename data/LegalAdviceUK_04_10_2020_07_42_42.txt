I was recently arrested on the above charges. I was apparently causing alarm and distress for raising my voice at one of the staff at my bank who told me my bank account was frozen. I started to record the manager and they called the police on me. About 10 officers arrived probably cause they told them I'm black. I was made to delete the videos which I did there and then. I was asked to leave and I did but I was still in front of the back on the road. The police came out and asked me to leave which I refused cause im pretty sure the road is a public place and im allowed to be there. After several warnings which I ignored I was arrested on public disorder offences. My bag was searched and a kitchen knife was found which is an 'offensive weapon'. Basically I went to court after being in custody for about 24 hours and they didn't have the papers I think so im waiting on my next hearing in about a month. Now while I was in custody, I did an interview. they asked me if I want a solicitor which I decline cause it was 1am and I just wanted to go home so I thought instead of longing out the process, I should just answer their questions. I explained my side of the story regarding the Public Disorder offences and I was very sincere saying I would apologise to the manager if he was here and I said I dont remember having a knife in my bag. I want to make clear here that im not admitting any guilt. I just turned 18 last month and ive never been arrested before so I might have fucked up in the interview and im starting to regret my choices. Im starting to panic and I don't know what to expect at my next court date and I don't know what to wear. some of you will judge me for my actions but all I want to know is if I'm convicted what do you think my sentence will be. bare in mind this is a magistrate's court. By the way, I was given a solicitor in court for some reason which was a good idea cause I was planning to run in there and just admit to everything and hope for the best.
