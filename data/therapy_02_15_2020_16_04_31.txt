This doesn’t happen often but when it does it’s scary. I’ll start in order. One night she busted into tears panicking that there were people outside her window and that they were coming to hurt her, and I finally got her to calm down and take some breaths, then it was like she had a switch flipped. I was talking, saying it was gonna be okay and her voice went deep and she said “hello??” In a concerned voice, so obviously I said hi back and she asked who I was. That’s when my stomach sank. I told her I was her boyfriend and that her name was Kennie and that I loved her. She had no idea what was going on. She snapped out of it a few seconds later and started sobbing again. It was agonizing to hear, knowing she was in pain. Everything was fine for about a month other than the occasional hallucinations of people in her window until about 30 minutes ago when she quickly got up and said she had to leave the room. I was kinda sus but just thought maybe she had to pee or something until I heard her stop at the stairs, so I went to get her and she turned back to me, holding in sobs again. I took her back to our bed and rested her head on my lap for a few minutes and everything was okay. I thought maybe she had fallen asleep, so I kissed her forehead and she started talking in a deep voice again. I think there was something inside her. It was saying “she’s mine, she doesn’t love you.” And that they were gonna hurt her, throw her down the stairs, they were burning her from the inside out. Then she went back to normal. Now she’s crying again telling them to stop and I’m getting scared. Her older sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and auditory and visual schizophrenic delusions. Her parents sent her to the hospital and she hadn’t seen her in 3 years. She’s refusing to tell anyone because she doesn’t want to end up like her sister but I don’t know what to do anymore. I wish I could be more helpful. I’m trying my hardest.
