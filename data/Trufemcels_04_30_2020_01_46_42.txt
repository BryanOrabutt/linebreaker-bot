So basically I kind of lost 20 kilo and glowed up (not much tho still fucked up facial bone structure). I started work in cruise line and quite a few guys started showing me attention, which I heard is normal for even below average girl on cruise ships. One guy though was really nice with me and helped me a lot and we started seeing each other. I would say it was rather more intimate than romantic, and honestly he was 50/50 either very kind and cute with me or mean like cold and just kick me out of his room whenever he felt like. But i fell in love and it was too late. He told me he is married. He also told me he likes mu friend who works with us. I asked why you like her and not me and basically he said she is his type. During these 3-4 months we were “together”, he would tell me he liked me and that i am his. Everybody would tell me he doesn’t but i was naive and never been like this in love. Now corona started. They are sending people home and mostly on my cruise ship people are from his country so they were all sent together a few days ago (i am still stuck here btw) and we haven’t talked a few weeks since he said “no more”, but ofc i tried and not one time to get back with him humiliating myself but what to do. And one day before he was leaving i was dying inside and i asked him if i cam pass by his room later to day goodbye as he doesn’t like to do anything is public. Oh, yeah he is married and told me later about it and i feel like shit about it but it was too late for me to change the feelings. I am trash. He said, no i don’t wanna say bye to you. My friend told me “u know he never liked you, he was in love with me and brought me present”, which she never told me before about. It’s been two days, and as pathetic as it sounds 1) i miss him 2) i was too ugly for him 3) he used me for sex and finally i will never find love because no matter what i do i will be an ugly shit :(
