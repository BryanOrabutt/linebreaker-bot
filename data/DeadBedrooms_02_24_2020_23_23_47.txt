I've (51W) dating a 52M for about 5 months. We had some serious health issues for the first 3 months but when they went away I realised he literally has no sex drive and hasn't even had an orgasm in over a year. I've tried everything to get some physical attention. Kissing, hugging, touching, hand jobs, blow jobs. (even spent 45 min down there one night until he actually came). He is obligatory when I ask him to help me have an orgasm but I almost have to beg a bit and it's rarely by actual sex. I'm always the one touching him and doing things for him unless he's drunk. When he's drunk he's super affectionate and loving but because he's drunk he can't get it up. I've had many straightforward conversations with him about what I need from the relationship and he always promises to try but never does. I go beyond what I need to do so he's happy and be proud to have me on his arm. I know he's had a messed up life but so have I, so has everyone. I've asked him if he'd get turned on if I bought a vibrator to use with him and he said no. I do love this guy because he treats me well otherwise and makes me feel safe and protected. I know that sex isn't the only part of a relationship but I'd like it to at least be once a week without feeling like I'm pulling teeth. I offer up a BJ or HJ all the time but he's not really for them. I finally said that if he can't make the effort to have sex with me then I can't stay with him. I get really sad watching love scenes on tv since I'm a 'push me up against a wall and let's f@#k till I can't walk anymore' kind of girl. This is super tough on my self esteem too. Am I wrong for actually giving him a deadline to act? I feel like I'm selfish because I shouldn't be so focused on sex. Also... I was single and celibate for 6 years prior to deciding to date again. I was really looking forward to a healthy relationship with sex as the cherry on top.
