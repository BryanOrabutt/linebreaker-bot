Alright where do I begin this weekend has been fucking spectacular (hint of some sarcasm) so I met some friends on Twitter on Thursday or Wednesday night and they seemed like wonderful people nice, chill, and very open but looks can be deceiving. I stayed up for a while talking to one of them and she made me extremely happy and so did the other two one male two females we became instant best friends and then the next day came we were talking more and more started to hit it off and then the day after that we got together and she asked me to help out someone that was going through something really bad and I said sure because I am a nice guy and want to help anyone I can but she also told me the ones that but this guy into this state was from the other two where they completely broke him because he did something wrong to the other girl who is now her ex and I don’t know what they told me about what he did was true or not and I felt sorry for the guy so I went to chat with him, no response and this was on Thursday throughout the entire time no response still don’t know if anything happened to him then me and the girl that I actually cared a lot about hung out over chats more and more and the other guy in the friend group had fun toying with what I believe in and what’s right and wrong and my moral code but contrary to what he believes none of it worked then the best thing happened today they came and told me that all of it was a ploy to tell my true colors and my intentions and they were calling me a liar, misogynist, a psychopath, and just trying to get under my skin and break me but they didn’t because I’m one stubborn teenager and I had enough willpower to keep me going to not cave in to them. But they told me everything I had with the one girl was fake she was used to figure out who I am which at first slightly hurt but I understood why they did it because it’s how they get their joy in life, their fun and everything, I wasn’t mad, disappointed, or anything I just stuck to what I believed in and who I am as a person, they all blocked me but made one simple request and that was to ask if the one girl would unblock me so I could leave on better terms with her but they said no and that’s how it was and there’s nothing I could’ve done about it and I accepted that, I also kinda turned into a piece of shit and before they blocked me I said I hope you all have good rest of the day and the thing is I meant it I really did and I still care for that girl even if they all lied to me. And it struck me as odd that I don’t feel anything about all of it now even after reflecting on it so long other then I hope that’s not what they do to have fun and if they do so be it at least they are enjoying things even if it maybe screwed up. Overall I’m just a really kind guy that cares for people and this world wasn’t made for someone like me but it still doesn’t stop me I will continue to be who I am even if this happens again so be it because I stand for what I believe in thank you for listening
