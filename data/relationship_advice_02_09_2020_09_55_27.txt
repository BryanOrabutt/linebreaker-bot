Hello, my boyfriend is in the army reserves, and he went out of town this weekend for training with his unit. We have been together for almost 1 year, and we live together (I’m 23 y/o and he’s 26) I’ve always been super skeptical of one girl in his unit in particular that seemed (in my eyes) that they were a little too friendly. He says they’ve never had relations of any kind before. Maybe I’m just intimidated by her so it makes me jealous, idk. Well last night, he and I said our good nights over the phone. About an hour later, I still can’t sleep. My boyfriend also has trouble sleeping, so I sent a text asking if he was awake. No response and eventually I fell asleep. I wake up this morning and it shows that he read my message at 1:50 am. For some reason, this seems suspicious to me, because I feel that he would’ve messaged me back by now. I charge his iPad, which is linked to his phone, and I see text messages between him and this girl, at 3:39am. She says she can’t find her sports bra, he responds that he has it. So I’m thinking, WHY THE F*** DOES HE HAVE HER SPORTS BRA?! I call him and start freaking out, throwing accusations. He says that before bed last night, the leadership moved their sleeping area, so a lot of people were in a hurry, some even moving other peoples’ stuff for them. He says that must be how her sports bra got mixed in with his stuff. Then he says that if I’m accusing him, and I expect him to have cheated on me, then we shouldn’t have been together in the first place. Which may be true, but I love him and care for him so much. I don’t feel like he would cheat on me, but at the same time I don’t feel like I deserve him and I feel like he could do better than me, so why wouldn’t he? Now I feel like the bad guy, because I call him first thing in the morning, going off over something that I really had no factual evidence of, just my accusations... how do I fix this feeling? How do I heal the relationship?
