So.. this is my first ever post on Reddit. First time posting about this ever. It’s happened when I was around 7 or 8. My mom and I were heading home from one of her friends house. Traveling down the US-60 in Tempe Arizona at about 12am or so. I know I was too young to be out that late but the party was a good one. We were traveling west approaching Mill ave or somewhere around there. Out of no where I saw red and blue lights from behind us but didn’t hear a siren. We were in the “ fast lane “ so all the way to the left. There were 4 lanes in total. I felt the car slow a little, so I assumed my mom was slowing down for the ambulance that was quickly approaching our rear. The next thing I know to our right, the ambulance quickly passed nearly hitting another car. Immediately after that, about 3 car lengths in front of us the ambulance darts strait into the concrete barrier. There was no crash, there was no ambulance. There was nothing! If a real ambulance crashed into that barrier, no one would survive that. Not to mention the mess there would be... I didn’t say anything at first. It was late, we were both tired, but I KNOW I saw something. I waited about 2 minutes and asked my mom if she saw anything weird just happen. She immediately stared crying. I didn’t say anything. Didn’t know how to react really. She got herself under control and said “ are you talking about the ambulance...? “ I KNEW I saw something! I asked her where it went. And she responded “ I don’t know, it just disappeared... “. That was over 20 years ago and my mom and I still talk about it to this day. Only that wasn’t the last time I saw it. That’s for another time though. I’ve told many people about this but they just think I’m telling a ghost story or making something up. If anyone out there is interested in hearing about the second time I saw this, I’ll post about it. And if anyone in the world has ever seen anything like this, please let me know.
