So I was with my girlfriend for a while and one night my friend told me that all of her friends were hooking up with people at the boardwalk and so that scared me terribly. I asked her and she didn’t respond. She said a few days later that she no longer loved me anymore and I cried in my bed for about 2 weeks, I couldn’t work I couldn’t do anything. My life had lost its purpose. I had gotten a job so I could afford to take her out to a nice restaurant and I never told her this because I wanted it to be a surprise. My life after that moment went into a spiral of depression and anxiety and that spiral still hasn’t stopped. I think to myself that I can’t be depressed and all of that jazz because I was happy in my younger years, but I haven’t been happy since. I still love her dearly and I miss her more than anything. She was supposed to be my sweetheart. I found out she was cheating on me with 2 guys at the same time on the boardwalk. One was my best friend and the other was my co-worker. I didn’t realize how bad I felt until I had the bad thoughts that most people have, but I was serious. I was going to attempt but my best friend (not the same guy) saved my life. It was just a hug he gave me. He just said that he was sorry for how she treated me and I still haven’t told him what I would’ve done that day. I’m feeling betterish now and I haven’t had many of those thoughts. I still love her and I realized I can’t be with anyone else. Everyone just reminds me of her. I keep the sharpie that she signed my yearbook with by my side constantly. She said she doesn’t love me anymore and I realized that she probably won’t ever again. I just want her back but I can’t have her. I love making people laugh with jokes and stuff because it distracts me from her. It’s a curse that I can make others happy but I just can’t make myself happy. I just want to be happy again. Is that too much to ask?
