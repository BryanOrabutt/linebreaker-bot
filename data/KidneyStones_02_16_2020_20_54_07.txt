I’m 19 F, I have had terrible kidney infections and kidney stones in my past. I was free of any kidney problems for almost a year then I went back on my ADHD medication because I can’t function without it. Just a month ago I had a kidney infection and was passing / trying to pass a 3 mm kidney stone. Skip forward to now, I’m having severe but not debilitating back pain, it’s enough to make me cry though. Went to the clinic near me yesterday, explained I felt sick, was having back (flank) pain that radiates to the front of my ribs or lower butt, sometimes brown pee, etc... they said it sounded like a muscular strain. Now I’ve had my fair share of strains in my back and don’t get me wrong they fucking HURT, but this pain was the same pain I had when I was passing the 3 mm KS and had the kidney infection. I sucked it up, went home, took 800 mg Ibuprofen as prescribed by doctor and I STILL was having pain in my flank(s). Later on I felt so helpless because I have been dealing with this pain for a few weeks and started to feel helpless, in ALOT of pain, and generally just feeling sick (I didn’t start feeling sick / nauseous until a day or two ago) so I went to the ER. They ran the tests, no kidney imfection. They didn’t want to run a CT to look for kidney stones because you can only have so many if your life. They then told me it was again, a muscular strain. I feel so helpless. I know it’s not a muscular strain, I feel it in my gut. Mind you, the pain goes from left to right, then it varies in pain. Sometimes it’ll hurt when I’m not doing anything other than laying in bed, sometimes it’ll hurt if I breath in / yawn, sometimes it’ll hurt if I move around. It hurt this morning and was like a dull ache almost as if my kidney had been punched. Other times it feels like someone’s stabbing me in my back. Sometimes it’s a sharp pang of pain. I feel so helpless. I have a Nephrologist appointment in March, I really hope they can get to the root of the problem.
