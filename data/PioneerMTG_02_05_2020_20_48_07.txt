Hi all! I've been playing magic for a pretty long time I was mainly playing modern but pioneer has come along and I really like the format one of the first nonhomebres decks I ever built was a budget magic list saffron olive posted called pelt collector evolve: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-88-13-tix-pelt-collector-evolve-modern which I played at several fnm's at my LGS and did pretty well with but I then built bogles and hadnt played it since that's until war of the spark happened and especially neoform happened and made the deck AMAZING I fell in love, while people were busy building broken neobrand decks I was busy playing monkey form in modern: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1919411#paper the deck felt perfect it had answers to everything and felt really fast I loved it, but sadly it felt like modern was still a bit to fast but then pioneer happens, and I realize that evolve can still be good in pioneer even tho it misses some cards, and I get to brewing and this is what I came up with: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2521693#paper the first fnm I took it to I went 4-0 against all main meta decks like vampires, black aggro, and mono g stompy and managed to come out on top because my deck has an answer most of the time main deck to everything because of neoform, although we do lose our undying creatures and pongify and because of that although it's legal I also don't play rapid hybridization because there is low synergy if allows me to play other great cards like [[greenbelt rampager]] which allows me to evolve all my evolve creatures very quickly I also have 2 tef3ri's in there because it's great protection for the control match up and allows me to instant speed neoform which feels great. The real all star of the deck which even when other people were playing monkey form in modern they still weren't playing it is [[huatli's raptor]] on turn 2 it turns your evolve creatures into a 3/3 and it's a 2/3 with vigilance for 2 Mana that's nuts. The best thing is turn 1 any evolve creatures turn 2 raptor then turn 3 [[neoform]] it go get [[renegade rallier]] which comes in with a counter it also evolves your evolve creatures then bring back raptor and proliferate both creatures making your evolve creature a 5/5 on turn 3 while you also have a 5/4 and a 2/3 vigilance all on turn 3 seems pretty good. I'm also trying [[inspiring call]] which has been awesome it just recks boardwipes and draws you a ton I love this card alot actually. If you guys have any suggestions for the deck or questions please let me know I plan on taking this deck to bigger events and will try to report how it goes!!!
