I left the mtc after only 1 week in. No, I wasnt shunned. I wasnt disowned. In fact, everything went back to normal quite quickly. Why am I so frustrated than? Here's why. My parents told me that they knew the mission probably wasnt for me in the first place after I came home. My grandparents weren't surprised when I came home early. It was like no one cared in the first place. My entire life from a young age I had been dreading the mission. People have dreams to look up to, I had a massive nightmare awaiting me for when I turned 19. I thought the only joy in life could be found in relishing the times when things weren't bad. I learned to not look to the future, but instead to focus on the present at all times. I thought there were just certain moments in your life that are destined to be miserable. I know I'm an intelligent person, but my grades suffered because I closed my eyes to the future. My self confidence plummeted to rock bottom. I never thought I would ever have a girlfriend, or even real friends. I thought I was destined to fail at every aspect in life. All I needed in my life was someone to say it was ok to not serve a mission. Ok to not be a mormon. And my family knew it wasnt right for me, yet they never said a thing. I feel so betrayed by them. Not to mention, my parents let my older brother pursue a career in baseball and ignore mormonism completely. The first step I'm taking is realizing that I'm not accountable for any of this. I didnt have a choice. I refuse to be guilt tripped and gas lighted any longer. I know why my previous experiences happened. Fuck my family for that. Fuck the church. Theyve ruined my life up until now. I'm taking the reigns on my life and doing it my way from now on. My family wont get credit for anything. In fact, they're my enemies. They're not on my side. They never have been. They had their fucking chances. Theyve done far more harm than good. I'm done pretending that their opinions of me matter in the slightest.
