For the last two years I was stuck in a loop of confusion, hurt, anger, and resentment. My bestfriend at the time introduced me to marijuana, and I became obsessed with it. Soon after, I tried shrooms, acid, mdma, coke, and dmt. Now at first, I started using marijuana for the pain relief and as a sleeping aid. I was working as a restaurant manager at the time and being on my feet 12 hours almost everyday took it’s toll. I was 20 years old at 220lbs w flat feet. Oof. It’s been 2 years since I started using all that stuff and about 8 months since I quit all of it including alcohol. Of course I quit like 10000 times, just to pick it up again but I eventually followed through. I’ve lost 30lbs and my mind set has done a 360 and I’ve gained understanding to why and what I was running from. It’s been very humbling and healing. I’m doing much better now and have done a lot of mentality work to reverse some psych damage that has been dealt and conquered a lot of bad habits. It’s been effective. HOWEVER I am now finding myself struggling to interact with others outside of work to have fun or “just be” without the influence of alcohol or drugs. They loosen me up and I’m able to have fun and be funny and sympathize with people. Idk it’s annoying bc I have a hard time loosening up and just be cool. I used to be fun before drugs and I knew what to say and how to say it but it isn’t like that anymore. I’m not sure what’s up but yeah. Having a hard time figuring out how to be again with out being high on something. Now, I’m just chill and quiet. It’s boring in my opinion. I love to talk but ppl seem shallow and I don’t or will not engaged in small talk. Idk asking if anyone else knows what’s up and maybe has any pointers? I imagine it’ll take time but it’s been 8 months so idk. Maybe I’m just an adult now? Idfk. All I know is that when I’m with people, groups, or one on one, I wish I was high.
