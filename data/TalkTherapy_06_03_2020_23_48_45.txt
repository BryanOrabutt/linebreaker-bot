So I started mental health therapy last week (over the phone). I have a history of drug addiction (I’m clean 14 months now) and self harm/suicidal ideation. I’ve been admitted once for a week. They diagnosed me bipolar. Anyways, I was taking medication but I stopped (I was still using drugs). Since I’ve been clean I haven’t been on any meds. The last time I cut myself was about my 3rd month clean. I have thoughts of self harm but I think that’s normal for anyone with a history of it. So I was having a ruff time a couple weeks ago and I had mentioned it to my outpatient therapist and she had me see the psych, who recommended either medication or inpatient but I refused both and said I’d rather try therapy first and if that really didn’t work I would consider going back on meds. So I started mental health therapy with another therapist who seems to really have it out for me to take medication. She just doesn’t like the fact that I don’t want to take meds (atleast now now) and I feel like she’s always asking me questions like “well why not?” and I’ll answer her with like “I just don’t think I need it right now” or my concerns with medications and she’ll be like  “but don’t you want to feel better?” and it’s just this back and forth moving nowhere conversation. So she’s having me see the psych (different from the one I see at my outpatient) to have me evaluated AGAIN and at this point I’m just exhausted from going through all these evaluations. Everyone telling me I need meds or I have issues or whatever when all I really want is to be able to be honest about how I’m feeling and where I’m at. I don’t feel like cutting myself but yea some days I have thoughts of it but I don’t do it and I don’t want to do it that’s why I’m being honest about how I feel but I feel like all anyone seems to think is that medications will fix it and I just want to know like am I deceiving myself? I can’t spot self deception myself so I guess that’s what I’m asking, am I crazy?
