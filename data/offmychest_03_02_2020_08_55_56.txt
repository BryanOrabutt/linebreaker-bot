i just broke up with my (18f) boyfriend (20m). we dated for 5 months. i went to a very white, majority-conservative high school and finally found my dream feminist/indie/progressive gamer boyfriend. we had a LOT of fun and i loved him. i really cared for him. one night, after a fraternity event, very drunk, he called me to come over. i walked to his apartment, and hung out with him and some friends. within 30 minutes, he gives me a funky look and i take him to the bathroom. i take care of him for about an hour. get his face washed, his teeth brushed, and into some pajamas. i asked him if he wanted me to wait until he feel asleep and then i could go back to my dorm, or if he wanted me to stay the night. he tells me to stay. i lay down and start to fall asleep. he kisses my neck. i tense up. i pull away and say “i dont really want to do anything tonight babe, im way too tired and youre fuckin drunk!! haha!!” before i know, he gets on top of me, shoves his hands into my pants, and then inside of me. i pushed him off, cried, and vomited. i slept on his couch, i couldnt go home- i would have lost it. i didnt break up with him at first. i didnt even start calling it assault until his fraternity brothers told me they wanted a statement after he had told countless people what he had done, and they reported it. i still dont know if it’s assault. he sounded so remorseful, i know we both know what he did was wrong, but it was so?? out of character?? he’s your token liberal arts school progressive sweetheart. he voted for bernie? his friends tell me he’s a good guy, it was just a mistake. and that i couldnt even believe the state he’s in right now.. i went home for about a week, and now just feel like im on autopilot. im not sure what to make of the situation and im having some trouble navigating this and at small university as well where i have to see him and all the people he told quite often. any feedback? advice?
