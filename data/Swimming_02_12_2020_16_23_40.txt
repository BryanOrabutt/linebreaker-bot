Hi my names Adnan I'm new to this community and hope to get help to get better at swimming.First time I ever went swimming I almost died from drowning by jumping into a 13feet deep pool without any experience of how to get out.mu friends convinced me to jump of a divi g board and said it would be ok just pretend your flying like a bird.But as soon as I jumped I panicked luckily someone jumped after me and I grabbed his leg to help myself.He saved my life.Soo later I wanted to get over my fear of water learning how to swim and make it a hobby . because I like swimming I just wasn't good at it.Because of this I got so motivated and ask my friends to help me get better and I would frequently go to swimming.I struggled a lot to learn how to swim first I start swimming then stop then when learning how to dive I panic and I inhale the water or I don't know how to hold my breath well.No because of this dedication I have gotten so much better I can dive now I to the water and when ik already in the water I can hold my breath for 30 seconds and I can do a couple of laps without stopping and swim on my back.But I want to improve.How can I float better and linger on my back?How do I dive better without belly flopping? How can I swim and dive comfortably in deep water?How can I hold my breath for longer and better?And any tips or advice on how to improve or things to work on?I want to learn how to swim like the Olympic swimmers like their technique I've seen a couple people do it at the pool I go to also.And it looks fine e and it want to learn how to do it so where can I start?My favorite way is when they start off with a dive in the the water move their legs up and down then go up while the head is still under water but they would inhale quickly and put their head back in the water and when they reach the end they do a front flip and go back.I love that technique but it also looks so diffuclt.
