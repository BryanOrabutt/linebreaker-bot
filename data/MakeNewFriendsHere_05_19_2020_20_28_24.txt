I'm a 24 year old male as the title says looking for people who will stick around for the long haul and are happy to message daily, I'm single (I don't know if this matters but I'm putting it here anyway), I'm from the east coast of the United States. I'm pretty chill and won't judge you on mostly anything at all, once I'm comfortable with someone I love talking. I'm a great listener I love to let people vent about their problems and I will usually try to help if I can and I don't get offended by much. if anyone would like to talk please feel free to start a Chat or PM me on here, say Hi and introduce yourself! I always try to respond as soon as possible! I'm always available anytime and I'm open minded so we can talk about anything you'd like! Feel free to ask any questions and be ready to help with the conversation because I'm not great at holding a conversation sometimes. I'd prefer someone in the same time zone (est) but I'm bad about sleep schedules so no big deal there. I love to send Good Morning/Goodnight messages and I always ask how your doing! I'm not going to list interests here because so far in my experience it doesn't matter because the people I've met through here have all been very different from myself but feel free to ask if we talk. I'm willing to use other apps like Snapchat, Kik or WhatsApp to chat if that's what anyone would prefer but bare with me if I don't immediately share pictures or anything on there I'm working on some shyness and self esteem issues! I felt I should specify that I would prefer girls, I've never had female friends in my life and I'm just looking for something new and appreciate input. I'm not looking for relationships just friends but I guess you never know and I'm 100% straight! Guys are Welcome aswell though so there's no issues there. I'd prefer people between the ages of 20-30 but as long as you're 18+ then I don't mind! Thanks to whoever reads this and have a nice day! I hope we get to chat soon!
