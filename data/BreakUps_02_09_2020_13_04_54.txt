I really need help on this one, I feel hopeless, empty, like a really bad person. well lets start from the beginning, well last year I met this awesome girl, she was so nice to me, I really felt good, so we started to talk, she gave me her number, and I was like "this girl seems very nice, but she doesnt know the real world" so I had a plan that I would treat her really bad so I would teach a lesson on how "people are bad" well I think it didnt turn out well, I dont think treating her like shit was a good idea at all and I really regret it, well while I was treating her bad, she cried, she suffered, but she has a good heart so she stayed with me, at one point she had enough, so she tried to get away from me, but I revealed the truth, we had our first kiss, and we started beeing a couple, it really was sweet, this girl is awesome, she is a really good person, she is innocent, pure, caring, loving, everything. well one of those days like she started to touch my leg (not in a sexual way, as I said she is pure) and I would get an erection, then I got frustrated and I told her that we do it or we break up (I was beeing dramatic and manipulative) she said that she would do it (by the way, she is really christian and I am not, shje wanted to wait until marriage) well I think it went downhill from there, long story short, we never had sex, but we touched eachother and that stuff, but I wanted more, I dont know what I was thinking, maybe that would make us more intimate, maybe its because I never had a gf and the doors to get sexual, I dont know, but that blinded me, she was feeling really forced by me, to do that stuff, she didnt want to, she just wanted me, and I wanted her too but my dick got in the fucking way and it ruined it all, I think that was the principal reason why she broked up with me, I was beeing manipulative and that stuff on other stuff but the sexual stuff was the strongest. she made me realise that I was a bad person and that I needed to change, she told me that she would have helped me if it wasnt for the sexual stuff, I am broken guys, she really was the other piece of the puzzle, I think I just needed some help so I could be hers fully too, because I did teach her a lot of stuff, but she is hurt now, really hurt, we have broke up some times before because of that sexual stuff, but there was still hope, she still felt love for me, so we got together, but now she told me she hates me, and it really hurts, I try to be sincere, I tell her that I was blinded, that I really care about her, that we could start againg, that I have changed, and she doesnt believe me, she thinks that im manipulating her, but I am really beeing sincere and speaking my heart off, I love her, I care about her, I think she is the one, I want to fix us, I dont know how to get her to come back, to see that I am really speaking the truth, that I have changed, that I see my wrong doings and that I will do my best to fix us, I will try me best to understand her and make her feel super loved, I dont know what to do guys, I really need help, we can only chat, and she isnt on all the time, what can I do guys? help please
