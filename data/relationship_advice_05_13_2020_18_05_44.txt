I'm a generally reserved person, I dont have friends, I dont talk to anyone outside my house, this isn't necessarily my choice, but it doesn't bother me that much. My ex, we'll call her Amanda, because that's her name, I know people use other people's names and whatnot but in this case, theres a million Amanda's, chances are if your name is Amanda and you're reading this, its probably not you. I digress I apologize, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for roughly two and a half years now, we have a ten month old together, our relationship is very strong, we click very well, same mindset, mostly same tastes in things, and she's fucking gorgeous, love her to death for real. Recently my ex Amanda messaged me, she pops in and out every like five months, she'll talk to me for a day, then ask if she can call me, believe it or not, I have a weird phobia for phone calls, I get A LOT of anxiety when making a call, even when someone asks me to make one I get weirded out, and in this case, she will ask me always around midnight after I put my son to bed, so, as you could imagine, the answer is always no, plus I dont think my girlfriend would be too happy hearing me talking to my ex at midnight. After I tell her no, she'll come up with some excuse to leave, then never talk to me again until a couple months later. Here's my problem, back when I was with Amanda, I was absolutely in love with this girl, and despite not actively thinking about her, I guess I still have some residual feelings? Every time she pops back up my heart starts pounding, my mind goes fucking everywhere I end up thinking about her for days after she bounces, dont get it twisted, I wouldn't cheat on my current girlfriend, we have so much invested together and honestly nobody can deal with me better than she can, she's perfect, and I dont want my son growing up in a broken family that shits way too common nowadays, but I can't help not feeling something every time Amanda comes back around, maybe it's just some kind of nostalgia? I dont know, you're probably figuring this had to happen recently otherwise I wouldnt be here, and you're not wrong, she messaged me 3 days ago, we did some small talk, tried to call me, I declined, she said she was driving her boyfriend's immediately after (it was like 1:30 in the morning) and I haven't heard from her since. This is all probably real stupid I apologize for the rambling and shit, I just got fed up with feeling this conflicted and decided to bring it here, maybe to get it off my chest, who knows.
