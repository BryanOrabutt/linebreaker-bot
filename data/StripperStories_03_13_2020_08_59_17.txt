Previously posted to my fb copied and pasted....Now as u read this I want you  to contemplate every aspect of what I'm saying seriously....and if u cant remember anytime u were there cause u were drunk then u cant really make a valid point cause i was sober when this happened....im so OCD when I'm drunk I'm still not really drunk and no I've had nothing to drink making this post.... Its bullshit  when even strippers go off looks.... itd be nice to go into a club once and get approached by the top notch girls.... but they're always preoccupied with the fit guys who dont even need to be in there.... or walk around acting stupid and avoiding the other dudes, and dont feed me the bullshit "it's all about money" cause regardless money or not if they've made enough money for the day or if noones buyin they'd rather waste time talking to physically attractive dudes than fugly dudes and no I dont go to strip clubs  at all but stopped  by one after the movies and only "one" approached but she was nowhere near as good looking as the others call me an ass but it proves my theory the less attractive ones work harder and approach more men the more attractive ones know there attractive so they dont have to approach men the men come to them but if not they'll just spend  there time with the tall skinny and or muscles guys or dudes that dress like there chicano hipsters aka "chill bru" dudes California types ummm so no it's not about money and I need to approach them cause they're afraid of rejection as the lady bartender said and she also said "u shoulda told me I coulda got u a dance"THATS NOT THE POINT LADY u dont go into a strip club and have a worker get another dancer for u the idea is to get approached.....if they're afraid of rejection then they wouldnt be approaching the physically fit guys that proves her theory wrong about $ cause the hotter ones can sit on any dudes lap they want but if they're killing time it's the type of dudes they'd see there self dating..........its "I know I'm hot I dont need u....u either u come to me or I'll talk to dudes I actually like if I'm bored" it's funny even a strip club is a fucked up system where even the workers go off looks and not personality aka "$" like they say and no idc if u think I'm weird for posting this.....idc who u are guy or girl we dont even have to spend any money u wanna come test the theory with me and we go in with a pencil and paper and make a chart and do an experiment and make a fucking youtube video out of it hit me up pick a random night let's do this shit it's actually a fucked up balanced system the hot ones work less the hot guys pay less the less attractive girls work harder the less attractive guys pay more....so even in a strip club were segregated.....I saw a whole group of tiny asian dudes and a couple girls reserve a table and they got NOOOOOO AACTION LMAO and no it wasn't cause of corona this was months ago the time with the asian dudes
