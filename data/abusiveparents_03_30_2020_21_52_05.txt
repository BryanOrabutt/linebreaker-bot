So I am a female speaker and my bus lane which is English I’m doing this via spoken text so it might be a bit strange, so when my parents broke up I was blamed by both sides not that I was actually doing anything it was just that I was alive my dad didn’t actually have much progress she was just more mad at my mum and women, however my mum was a narcissistic woman she was very abusive and have a very misconstrued concepts of what you should do as a parent she even worked any in the social care and social worker back round with as well as a police officer a nurse and God knows what else you could never stick with anything, I remember though grounding for me was basically when I was growing up people use it on my room so I requested a lock my doors they come in at the rain appropriate times that’s a whole Nother story for home at that time but my mum uses luck against me and if I was grounded she would lock me in my room days at a time call in sick to my school and say that I wasn’t coming in I was not allowed to go out to use the toilet are used to Ben then are use the bin and often threw it out the window towards the outside even have my mum could never keep this up too long is she pretty much use me as a slave cooking and cleaning in the house everywhere,, I had dealt with this a few times so tired often planned ahead I wasn’t allowed to eat their food so I had all my food and drink in my room are used to get the cheapest Coke but then was six or 8p and are used to buy chocolate that was 5p dark chocolate along with what are they called cheese balls and they were like 50p “filling I never had anything for you to go to school with because I thought it was a waste nearly every aspect of my life so I would have to be locked in the mood I’m also a chronically ill person I’ve been chronically ill since the age of 13 due to serious not like and as I got older I realise that this isn’t what grounding is and you should not be locked in your room you should be allowed food you should be allowed to use the toilet then you should definitely be allowed a bath sheet it will be mad at me for watching things should pull out my cable which is attached through the hall which is a big hole very cold because that Holly was for coming so she just read that out the wall and I wouldn’t have Internet access but I did have a phone that I will top up and could talk to people I’d say it was quite a traumatic time and I found out that during that in war that people have to be given food and they should also be given the opportunity to use the toilet as a chronically ill person I think this was terrible and I really needed a bit of support around me.
