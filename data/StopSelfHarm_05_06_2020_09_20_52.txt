I’ve been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 2 years now. The main reason for these thoughts is that I choose to distance myself from my alcoholic father, he was such a great dad and always super supportive. I now know that my whole family on his side is mad with me for running away from my problems, I can’t see myself wanting to see him or any of my family members anytime soon and it kills me inside. I am now living with my mom and younger sister, my moms side of the family is just my grandparents and my Unkle, I’ve lost all my family connections and I’m really in pain. I’m living with so much constant regret and self hate, everyday is a real struggle. I’ve also recently lost my bf from an overdose, the whole situation is a living nightmare! The amount of fakeness in this world makes me sick to my stomach, everyone around me is acting like they were always there for my bf when they really weren’t. I’ve recently lost weight when I had no weight to loose and I’ve now lost fat under and next to both of my eyes which has just made me want to kill myself even more. Nothing in this cruel world makes me happy or to continue going through all this pain. I know how much pain and sadness my family would feel if I were to harm myself and that’s the only thing that’s keeping me alive rn. I’ve lost all my friends due to depression and just being too lazy for them I assume. I can’t motivate myself to do really anything anymore and it’s really not good, I’m so skinny and unhealthy looking at this point. I’ve been in a daze for many years and I just haven’t been present at all. I have lost almost all my interests and hobbies I feel so boring and bland. Really considering overdosing atm and that’s why I’m writing this, expecting someone to comment “it will all get better soon” but it really won’t and I’m sure of it. I’ll be surprised if I make it to 2021 at this point. Someone please help me I’m miserable, fragile and scared.
