I just had this very vivid dream where i originally looking for some mysterious island with a small crew (the crew is random people that is not someone i know) about six people i think, each of us ride a jet ski and i don't know why but i decided to wander into some foggy place myself while the others move ahead of me, the fog is freaking thick and there is some sort of border / wall preventing the thick fog out of the island with a vine tree (No, it's not attached to a tree, it's a thick hard vines that surrounds the outer island right on the coast and each time it forms a pillar-like shape that resembles a tree but there's no tree at all), i wander in to there and for some reason i suddenly have a thought what if this fog is actually a radioactive and i've been inhaling it for quite a while and then i move out of that island as fast as i can and skip to the next day because i didn't remember this part.. we walk around the island then the crew said yes there is a radioactive nearby and they laugh at me for going into something so obvious and then i laugh as well but this one crew got his face deformed and later i feel pain in my breathing, i slowly lost my vision while writhing in pain and right before i die, there's a flash image of the crew some sort of taking photo together smiling creepily with their deformed bodies and then i wake up on a bed (not my bed) and then there's one guy waiting near my bed sitting on a chair and this guy is one of my crew (at the time, i don't believe i'm dreaming and at this point i hoped that it was all a dream) i start to imagine having a pistol in my hand and i quickly shot him on the head then somehow the time resets again and i wake up in that same bed with that guy beside me, the guy now tells me "Oh no, i won't let you wake up" then the guy start chanting some shit and i had a clear image of me waking up in my bedroom with a shattered glass like effect within my vision, i'm fighting as hard as i could to not let go that image because it starts to fade away thanks to that piece of shit chanting weird spells, the shatter effect just shattered and then i wake up for real this time and man, i quickly go to reddit just to post this shit
