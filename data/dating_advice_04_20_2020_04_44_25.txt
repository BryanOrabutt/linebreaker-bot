So to start just a little background, I (24F) met this person (32M), let’s call him C, about 2 years ago on a dating app. When we met I had absolutely no interest in him and I ignored him for the most part. He gave up for a while and about 6 months ago started being very persistent again, so I decided what the heck why not give him a chance. We started hanging out and I felt we had a good thing going, basically the only thing that I do not like about C is that he has a bunch of female friends that We both know are interested in him romantically and he refuses to set boundaries for them. So yesterday we were hanging out and a few of his friends show up, 2 of C’s female friends have a little too much to drink and start dancing on him. Which upsets me and I let C know, his defense is they’re not his type and he doesn’t find them attractive, I tell him that I feel disrespected by it and he gets upset because I don’t see it the way he does. Earlier that day C opened one of my social media accounts to take a picture and noticed I had a few male friends in my recent messages (none of which I replied to) and by the end of the night he was really distant, so this morning I text him to ask what’s going on and he says “I think we should just be friends” when I ask why he says I’m “too much” I asked what he meant and he says “For someone that’s entertaining 4+ guys on social media you sure like to f*$k up a perfect day for nothing” I don’t understand how me ignoring other guys on my social media compares to a female rubbing up on him when she’s aware of our relationship. So now he doesn’t want anything to do with me, but I like him alot and I don’t want to feel like I am begging for something. Also if I am wrong I have no problem apologizing even if he still doesn’t want to speak to me. Sorry for the super long post. Also HELP :(
