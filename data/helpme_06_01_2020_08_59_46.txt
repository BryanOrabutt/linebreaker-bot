Hey guys, there’s this girl that I met about 7 months ago and i instantly fell in love with her. the way she makes me feel is so surreal and it’s like i’m living in another universe when i’m around her. she liked me to begin with and when i started liking her i just fell into something and we tried to date but we made a mistake of entering the talking phase. we stopped “talking” and decided to start over so we could both have time to decide if we really wanted to get into anything. i was always so scared to ask her if she was ready to start actually dating and i never asked, i was everything for her. i did everything to help her. i went to all her games. stayed up with her until all hours of the night when she was sad. i did everything i needed to do to be the perfect boy for her, but one day she suddenly started to act different, and the way she looked me in the eyes changed and i instantly recognized this. I asked her so many times what was wrong and she always said it was nothing. until one day i got mad she wouldn’t tell me and i said “ok be this way”. i felt like a complete dick for days and cried a lot. me saying that gave way to her telling me she didn’t wanna talk to me anymore. everyday i miss her even more. everyday i look at all those cute snaps she sent me. and i think about all those good times we had. and i miss her more than anything in the world. it’s been this way for 2 months, and i don’t like the way it is. i can’t think straight. i can’t eat. i can’t sleep. i can’t do anything because not having her is such a burden on me. i wanna text her so bad. and tell her how i feel and how sorry i am for everything i’ve done. my heart wants me to. it tells me that everytime i look at her. but my mind tells me she doesn’t want me and it’s gonna make things worse. so that’s where i hope you guys can help me. should i text her and tell her how i feel. or not?
