I have been sexually active since I was 12 ( I am 14 now) and I have always found older men more attractive so I have been tricking people online and set up dates as an 18 year old then when we meet up I (sometimes) talk them into it. Some people seem to regret their decision and some of them even cry afterwards. Sometimes I get some hush money from "straight" dudes .  One of my most memorable  encounter was with a 47 years old man "lets call him Mark". As usual I set up the date online and when we meet up I told him that it is okay I wont tell anyone I have done this before blah blah blah... When I convinced he decided not to take me to his place instead we went to a midrange hotel with  2 or 3 stars. We went to our room he took a shower ( an unusually long one) when he came out we turned some music on started to make out. Skipping the details we had sex for about 30 minutes then I fall asleep. When I woke up he was praying while crying (very embarassing view for a 47 year old, I think) when he saw me he stopped praying told me to get dressed. We got on his car and his phone rang. I suppose it was his wife telling him to pick up the childeren from their grandparents house. He told me If I minded I said no expecting a toddler. When we arrived there were a biy and a girl waiting by the front door. One of them was older than me the other one was around my age. It was pretty awkward for a few minutes until he drived me to the subway station near home.( I wasn't  born American I arrived at the states when I was 9 when my mom married my step dad who is american then two years later they got divorce and my mom signed off my rights to my stepdad or something like that I do not have the legal details to be honest but now she i out of the picture anyways the reason I am telling this is my english is still kinda bad dont get too stuck on the grammar issueas but  be free to fix them)
