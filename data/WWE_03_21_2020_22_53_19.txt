This isn’t 100 gonna work but you will have a good chance if you follow these steps.                                        1. Being a veteran in wrestling helps a lot look at stars like triple h, John cena, undertaker, and others built up the ranks shows everyone at wwe that your a reliable worker.                                                                     2. Having a mma background also helps stars like Shayna Baszler, Brock lesnar, and Ronda Rousey got heavy pushes because being a former mma background makes you look like a bad ass.                            3. Having good promo skills, stars like John cena, the rock, stone cold Steve Austin got big pushes. Think about it if stone cold didn’t do the Austin 316 promo would he ever gotten this much praise? Or John cena if it wasn’t for his rhymes he would of been just another wanna be gangster.                                                 Misconceptions(this is what people think it takes to become a great wwe wrestler).                                           1. Coming from another company. Stars like ricochet, Bobby Roode, Raven, Tazz (after debut) and others did well for in other companys, but that doesint mean your gonna have a successful career in wwe. You could be someone like somoa joe destroying everyone in another company but then go to wwe and not really living up to the hype.                                                            2.having a great physics. Even tho there has been people with great physics that got pushes, there has been many people with great physics that didn’t become a successful wrestler. Stars like tony neese, ec3, ricochet, and others that had really good physics but don’t get pushes.                                                        50/50 chance this might work.                                            Getting over by yourself without the help of creative can either hurt you or catapult you. Becky Lynch turned heel and got popular and at wrestlermania everyone wanted her as champion. Zack Ryder did well at first then got destroyed by Kane and doesint appear on tv that much.
