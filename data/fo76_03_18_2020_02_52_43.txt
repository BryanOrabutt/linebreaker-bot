Ok just if you may hear me out PSN player here, I met someone playing this game and they're the nicest person I've played with and would absolutely give you their shirt off their back and they have been screwed over many times due to their niceness if that is a word.  She collects certain things and has all but one asylum dress, which one well the red one of course.  The people I knew that had some and I thought were cool mates of mine ended up having five and just teased her and wouldn't want to do any trades or deals I ended up deleted them as they only ever just asked for things to not help in return.  I'm really trying to help her farm just to get one for her so she can wear it and just enjoy it because she really deserves it.  I feel the trading community just lost their minds and have gone just mental over it and I'm just reaching out I know long long shot here to see if anyone has one that would give it so I can get her the dress to enjoy.  I would make a video to show case it for whoever would do so.  She has been farming and working on caps and 5.56 as well so we can always get you situation but I'm really just asking someone let's make someone happy.  Now there's no way I can prove to you any of my intentions just my word and I would certainly make a nice video to show the gift giving.  If any PSn player would like to help me get this done I think it would restore a bit of my faith in people for kindness.  I encourage you to just inbox me so no one else tries to harass you or what not and I am certain this post will remain here and probably get smart mouth comments or down votes but if you're serious just inbox me.  It just kills me to constantly work on trying to make someone happy who just really deserves it and whom my former so called fo friends have done to taught and upset her.  Thank you for reading my long winded post and hey cheers.
