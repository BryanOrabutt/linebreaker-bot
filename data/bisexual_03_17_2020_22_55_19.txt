So probably one of the biggest moments of my life went down the other night. So basically a couple of months ago I posted here to ask for support on how to come out, thanks to u/Emperor_pengwin for giving me such good advice, I don’t think I would have been able to do it without him/her. So basically my story actually began with a confrontation, my friend, who once again I will refer to as J is a “openly” bisexual guy, although he initially came out as gay, he quickly realised he wasn’t, but people don’t listen to him when he tries to say he’s not gay. Anyway the past week he was being a jack ass, like a really big jack ass, just trying to annoy everyone for the sake of it, or so I thought. I confronted him with it in a long message to him, and about 15 minutes later he replied, explaining himself. Now I’m not usually one to get overly emotional but, it made me cry, like a lot. He explained he’s going through a rough time and that he is internally struggling with his sexuality. It was a lot more in depth than that so that’s why I cried, I apologised profusely, although I know he still shouldn’t of been an asshole to us, but hay ho we are all human. The guilt I felt for not noticing and not being there really overwhelmed me, thankfully he assured me it wasn’t my fault and that he should have opened up to me. Anyway because of his message of struggling with his sexuality, I just..... something sort of came over me and I couldn’t control it. I simply typed out the words “J, I’m queer as hell” (which isn’t exactly true). Followed by some messages about how I’ve been holding that back for ages, the amount of times I typed that out, then didn’t send it is astronomical. But yeah I finally said it out in a moment of confidence. I cannot express how grateful I am for him, we sat and talked for 3 and a half ours, where he showed nonstop support and gave amazing advice, he allowed me to ask him questions and tell him my worries. Of course though there’s always something hidden deeper, I have a overwhelming crush on him, like really. But the good thing is he seems to share that with me. Im still no where near ready to tell anyone else but I’m just so happy that I said to him when I did. So if you’re having problems coming out then please refer to the advice u/Emperor_pengwin gave me [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/e2rraw/looking_for_advice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and always remember that what you are doesn’t change who you are x ☺️☺️
