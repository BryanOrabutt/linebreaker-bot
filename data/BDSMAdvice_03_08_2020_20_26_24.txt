So my girlfriend is submissive and she has been dominant maybe 6 or 7 times in a little over the two years we have been together. I constantly feel like I'm making a sacrifice because I'm more towards submissive and she is pretty much 100% submissive and I will dominate still to make her happy, and it seems really one sided. I try to make myself or push myself to do what she likes because I want her to have a good time, but then it's hard for me to have a good time as well, and so I feel like she doesn't make any sacrifices / put in any efforts to go and explore the things I'm into. For example, she is into the DDLG dynamic, and I'm completely the other way, I don't like it at all whatsoever... But for the past 8 1/2 months ( since she moved in with me ) I had rewired my brain and I made myself play that role... Every... Single... Time. Not a single day had gone by where she thought to maybe change it up or thought that maybe I don't like this.. Even when I told her, she would say okay then go back to it and recently I opened up completely about me not being able to do the DDLG stuff any more, that I wasn't into it and she had said okay then no more. But here we are a month later and she expects it again. It's hurting me and I feel we are sexually incompatible, but I love her and I don't want to leave her, even if I did I don't feel like I could do better. so now I really feel trapped. Also, one more thing to note is that if I don't dominate, we don't have sex -  Like if I approach it in any other way including just plain vanilla sex then, it doesn't happen and she makes excuses like her body hurts or whatever.. But if I make myself dominant, she changes and the stomach ache that had been going on or the arm that was hurting, magically stops hurting that night. It's pathetic but anyways... Sorry for the book, I'm just hurt and stressed and need help.
