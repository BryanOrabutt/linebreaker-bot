I'm a 28 year old male who almost got into a relationship with a 24 year old female last year. We talked for a couple months and she finally admitted to me that she liked me. I have had a thing for this girl for years and over the months before she told me she liked me I messed around and pretty much fell for her all the way. Two weeks after she admitted to liking me she claimed she changed her mind, said she misjudged her feelings for me, said she wasn't ready for a relationship and tried to let me down in the nicest way possible and still attempt to be friends. I got angry because I felt as if I had been let on, and disrespected, so I told her basically the reasons why I thought she really didnt want to get with me. I didn't cuss her out or anything but it upset her alot and we both wound up telling each other we still cared for the other although we were mad. She has commitment issues and I feel that she just straight up got scared and ran, but I was sick of it all so I just gave up. We haven't talked in a month and a half and she also quit interacting with me on social media at all so I pretty much gave up and was ready to move on to other women or just be alone. Today is my birthday and she took the time to text my phone for the first time in a month and a half and wish me a happy birthday and tell me she hopes that I am doing well. Am I crazy for thinking that she might still care for me deep down somewhere? Last week I found out she is still upset about what happened and was telling Amy of her female friends that will listen about it all so I know it's still on her mind. Part of me is like she is just being nice, then the other is like she knows how much I liked her and if she didn't want anything to do with me she wouldn't be texting my phone. To be honest as of a month and a half ago I was in love with this woman and I've spent the past month and a half trying to forget about her, so this sort of messes with my head to be honest. Any advice is welcome.
