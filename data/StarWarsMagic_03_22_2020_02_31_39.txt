I might sound dumb but forgive me if I do, but I have been having dreams and thoughts of a new Star Wars Movie where The Dark Side has a physical form to finally control the Universe and Hayden Christensen returning as Anakin Skywalker in the next Star War movie, this time he's Rey's son (Anakin reincarnated), The story is like this: Rey finds a young boy and takes him under his care, the boy exhibits great force potential similar to the stories of young Anakin, so Rey names him Anakin Skywalker in memory of the real Anakin, the boy grows up under Rey's training and becomes a fine Jedi, falls in love with a woman (Padme reincarnated), and then again sees vision of Padme dying and even flashbacks of his previous life, The new villain (Physical manifestation of the Dark Side) tells Anakin that he would be able help to save Padme (just like Sideous did) and orders to kill the younglings, Anakin walks up to the younglings and gets a flashback of his previous life where he killed them and then the movie is in intermission* Anakin tells The Dark side that he killed the younglings, but this time Anakin good force side kicked in and he hid the younglings instead of killing them which is revealed when the movie is nearing to it's end, Rey is old now, faces the Dark Side, and when The Dark Side is about to finish Rey, Anakin shows up and faces the Dark Side, An epic battle is fought, Anakin is at his limit and then Anakin loses and then The Dark Side says "Before I kill you, I will kill your so called mother infront of you" and then Anakin has flashbacks of his training and Obi Wan's Ghost talking to his mind saying that "The Dark Side fights only for himself, while you on the other hand are fighting for something other than yourself and that is where you can break your limit, find your true self Anakin, You are the chosen one" then Anakin unlocks his full potential and starts moving mountains, bending space controlling multiple lightsabers with the force with his force power and overpowers The Dark Side and then The Dark Side uses lightning on Anakin, and pushes the planet they are on to the nearest sun to be destroyed. Anakin also produces a similar lighting power and they produce a huge sonic wave over the planet when their lightnings hit (because they are overpowered) and then Anakin starts to win, Rey is lying on the floor and sees all the Ghosts of the great Jedis watching over Anakin and speaking and Obi Wan saying "I know he'll be back, He's the Chosen One, Always have been", and the most important and epic moment when Yoda is smiling and saying "THE FORCE, HE IS" and then and epic music comes up and Anakin finally defeats The Dark Side and then he single-handedly uses the force to pull back the planet they are on to it's original orbit. And then at the end of the movie Anakin marries Padme and have children and name them Luke and Leia... Please forgive me if I have made some grammatical errors or spelling mistakes because I'm not that good in English but I have been having this story in my mind for so long that I had to write it down.
