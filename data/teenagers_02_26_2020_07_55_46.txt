2 wolves were out to fetch whatever scrap they can bring home, one a father of 3 and another a younger wolf, the two went on for hours on end without even coming upon a single carcass to bring home, they cannot hunt down a deer for there is only 2 of them and it takes 4 to even assure that the deer will die, in addition to this, the forest floor is already covered in about half a wolf's body, atleast in this area, and deers would not lumber around in the cold like this, their only hope is a carcasse abandoned by a bigger predator,the younger one suggested jokingly "Why don't we eat the grass by the hill, no snow is present on the hill and if deers can survive on it we should too", "then why don't you take a moment to go their see if you can stomach it,and if you do maybe theyll accept you into their herd"both chuckle only for them to keep going to find a meal to bring home, hours went on until a moose carcass was spotted, with stomach for brains they came closer hoping to drag whatever is left of the poor moose home, not even noting that the skin has been cut so clean it couldn't be a beasts kill, no Claws or Teeth in this forest can cut like that, and no blood is spilling from the corpse and is conveniently located in a clearing, but without even batting an eye they ran closer to the corpse, a rope snags against their leg pulling more and causing a log to fall and a net to rise, the two were caught against a hunters trap. for a moment ,realization didn't take place and both fell in silence, the younger one laughed and said "A empty stomach would be better than being in something else's stomach" no remarks came from the othe, Men were known for snakes that summon vines, the ability to send wooden snakes to the air to bite other animals that their venom will stop the animals life, even branches that summon fire that will give an inevitable death to the ones they are aimed to, the wolves don't dare call these things animals, they were demons who have the power to bring a whole forest to ashes if they desire, "are we to be subject to their mercy?" the younger replied with "Do these demons even know mercy?" It would be long before they would check their trap, after all even being demons they take the time to sleep, the moon is not even over through the midnight mark, but in due hours the two already felt hungry, "These demons could atleast have been kind enough to feed their captives, No?" "Only a bone with little meat were with them in their dangling coffin while they hover above a whole carcass that can feed 2 families,Suggestions came from each one after the other "what if we chew the rope?","No,this Bind is not like the vine that one can chew through, we can spend days on end and still only make a such progress","what if we shake this net side to side maybe we can loosen it", "Traitor's of their kind have been binded with the same knots used here and frankly even mountain lions cannot break away when leashed to a tree. hours have passed and hunger has surpassed the morality of the young one and jokingly said "what if I eat you that I may die with a full stomach" the older one thought long and hard but refused the offer he began insisting that he kill him that he can eat, even in a tight net like this they can still claw and bite each other, he repeats the same offer but angrier evry time he does, he gives up on courtesy and decides to bite his tail the two fought until both were bleeding and one was dead the younger one is now gnawing at the leg of his companion fullfilling his stomach's wishes, I will take his place as father and raise his family to repay him he insisted himself doing good and that he is only commiting a necessary sacrifice. Dawn has come and the hunters have arrived, once cut loose they see 2 wolves one dead and another frail but still alive, "their hide and fur are no good, and how vile of the other to eat one of his kind" the remaining cannot move after being suspended in the cold for hours on end he moves as if he was to die, but the hunters chose to ignore him as his hide was just as teared and bloody and will not cost even a dollar to the hunting party, they take their leave, but as soon as they leave he grabs the leg of the moose carcasse to drag it back home insisting that he is doing a necessary evil to pay for what he did, he was doing a good thing he said, he insisted that he is good and if both of them were to die no food would come to his companion's family when he came back search parties of two have returned earlier to show no meal but he came back alone, bloodied and injured bringing a single moose leg, the others asked him where is their leader as his companion was the alpha of the pack, he chuckled and said "If I have not killed and eaten him I would not have brought this to you" in their society whoever killed the alpha replaces him so he was now pronounced as the leader, but not even a night later he was mumbling to a wall constantly insisting that "If I have not killed you everyone would be starving" as if he was talking to his companion the others were hesitant of letting one who has been entranced by the moon to lead them so they plotted to kill him in his sleep, the day later the former alpha's son took the lunatics place as the leader and he was still so young and clueless,that her mother was to guide him until he can lead but they failed to anknowledge the good that the lunatic has given them, If I have not killed him you all would be starving was his last words but they paid no attention to his wailing and teared him apart regardless the moose leg he returned was enough to have fed the whole pack for just another day but this good has been outshined by his companion's murder and he is no longer the hero who saved the pack he is no longer good for he was following the moon
