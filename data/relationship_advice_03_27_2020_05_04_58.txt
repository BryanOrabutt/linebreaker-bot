my boyfriend (22) and i (21) have been together for a little over 4 months. he’s only had a couple girlfriends in the past from high school. anytime i get annoyed or bothered by something that he does, he doesn’t know how to handle it. for instance, today he posted a video on instagram for a challenge and it was of him doing push-ups with no shirt on. this bothered me because when we are together hanging out and even having sex he is always wearing a shirt. my concern was if other girls slid up to that post of him and how he would respond to that. when i brought it up to him and explained how it bothered me that he posted a shirtless video on instagram but is never shirtless when i spend nights at his house, he was confused and did not know how to communicate through this issue. he made me feel like i was overreacting and didn’t know what the issue was even though i clearly explained why i was upset. our last couple disagreements went the same way..he didn’t know how to handle it. he told me that it was because of a skin condition, which i noticed before, but it still bothered me that he could be shirtless for instagram but not me. i don’t want to seem insecure but i don’t know what he would do if he was approached by a girl trying to flirt with him. he doesn’t snapchat or text any other girls, which i’ve seen proof of, but i still don’t know what he would do in that situation which worries me. i feel that it could’ve been easily resolved if he just gave me reassurance and addressed my feelings. i’m worried that we won’t be able to communicate in a healthy way when i’m upset. things usually end up worse when i mention them, never getting resolved. i just end up dropping it and moving on because i get sick of going back and forth. i understand he doesn’t have a lot of relationship experience, but i feel that i shouldn’t have to teach him how to deal with me. i was very calm and explained and expressed myself in a straight forward way. please help.
