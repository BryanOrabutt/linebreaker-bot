I don’t want to make this thing too long, About a year ago I began to date this girl who I had an amazing bond with. Well the dating thing didn’t work (lasted about 2 months), but we still chose to remain friends. From then to now she would tell me about the dates she went on and the guys she liked even the guys she’s slept with. She would stop talking to me randomly whenever she began to actually like someone. I didn’t mind it, I was letting her do her thing. Then out of nowhere she would begin talking to me again usually was when things were begin to go rocky with the guys she was into (happened a total of 3 times). I never really minded, on the contrary, I thought me hearing all that would help me officially move on. Not too long ago I still found myself feeling feelings for her. I came to the conclusion that the only way I could move on from her is to completely remove myself from her life. So rather than just completely cutting her off, I told her... I don’t think it’s fair to you and to me that I still feel this way. I want to get rid of these feelings I have. I want to be able to look at you and not feel anything. So we can have a real friendship. I feel the only way that could happen is if I remove myself. Until these feelings go away. I understand if you don’t wish to speak to me once I feel ready. I hope you’re understanding and do welcome back, as I did with you when you would cut me off. Again, I understand if you don’t.... she didn’t take it to well. She told me ...those feelings should have been gone a while back and you should of been honest with yourself, given yourself the space back then before we got closer... we’ll it’s been two weeks since we spoke and I’m struggling. I genuinely want to get rid of these feelings but it’s hard. I always find myself wanting to reach out even tho I know I need to distance myself. Any advice on how to move on without giving in?
