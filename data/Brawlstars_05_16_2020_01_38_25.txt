(WARNING, RANT AHEAD) Maybe the title was a little bit of an exaggeration but honestly not that much. When I first heard about the update I was excited for the increase in rewards but in order to get the same amount of rewards as you used to you have to grind wayyyy more. Pre update was a simpler but in my opinion better time, you could get all the tokens every day by playing a few matches and then you could open a couple of boxes, or if you save up enough gems you could buy token doublers to get 4 boxes a day. Now, if you only grind the tokens you get wayy less rewards. Just as an example one of the tiers is 400 tokens for 50 coins, seriously supercell is that some kind of joke? I know some tiers are more value and whatnot but that's also a flaw, one day you can get a mega box or you can get 50 coins on another day for the same amount of tokens. I used to only like playing like 10 brawlers in solo showdown, why I like showdown the most is a different story but that was how I enjoyed the game. Now, I have to use brawlers I really don't enjoy playing for a long time to get rewards that just aren't too exciting. Some examples of what I have are: killing 24 enemies with bo, or deal 300000 freaking damage with piper. Yeah, it rewards 500 tokens but in a world where 400 tokens gives you 50 coins it's not that exciting. Maybe I am just at a roadblock and if I grind through it it will be more fun afterwards but it's not fun to grind so you can grind for actual rewards. I feel kind of sad because I know most of the players like brawl pass but I just don't find myself eager to play the game just because I just really don't enjoy the current state of the game, if I am wrong about all of this and if I really do just need to get past tier 7 feel free to roast me in the comments. Sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to state my opinions.
