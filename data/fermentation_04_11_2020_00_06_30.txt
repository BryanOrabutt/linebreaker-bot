 I usually turn fish guts into garum. I make it in gallon jars. It's   mince of fish guts 3 parts, and sea salt 1 part. The fermentation lasts 1   year in a jar with a loose lid. The oil floating on top actually seals   it off from air, and the jar lid being loose lets out the gasses.  Garum  is the liquid you get after straining the ferment through a fine  cloth  and skimming off the oil. It should be an amber brown like the  color of a  beer bottle, and clear (the exact shade will vary with the  species of  fish). You boil the solids to get a second quality garum.  You use the  second quality garum for cooking, and it is very pale in  color and light  in flavor. The first quality is for dressing a dish or  can be put on  the table. It is similar to soy sauce, but has a pleasant  fishy funk to  it. It has a strong earthy taste, and a satisfying  feeling when added to  an otherwise light meal.  Garum was the favorite  seasoning of the Roman  Empire. It is still part of the Cuisines of  Sicily, Greece, Corsica,  and Turkey. Similar sauces exist in Asia as  well, but can be made in a  variety of ways with a variety of sea foods.  In all cases though, 25%  salt by weight is needed to make it safely as  this high concentration  kills harmful bacteria and parasites that  might be in the fish. No water  is added. The fish market people always  look at me weird when I ask  them to save and refrigerate the guts for  me. I buy them by weight. 7  lbs of guts and 1 3/4 lbs of salt will fill  a 1 US gallon jar. You can  toss in peppercorns, citrus peel, chilies,  coriander seeds, fennel,  garlic, or other spices in moderation. Just be  sure they are dried  beforehand so their water content isn't a factor.
