My whole life,ive been holding something up,something I cant even describe but ive realized a big issue in my life has been trust and I genuinely dont trust but its instinctive and ive never learned what is this horrible feeling i have and as i was walking and talking to myself i realize i dont trust and on the walk home I just kept saying give up,give up,again instinctively i let it come out like i said i dont trust anybody come out.saying this made me literally feel better physically but i still have something pulling me back and idk what im gonna do about my problems but then i realize just give up ,give up,give up,and not to say give up on life but just give up as in give up what you think,and let it be,giving up feels right and i still dont know why it does but it does im not trying to sound nuts here but i want you to think if your holding some thing in let it out on a walk by yourself dont let your mind take you away from whats beautiful my whole life ive been holding some thing up but the key is giving up there isnt ajything anything you can do just let go in the sense that there is a wieght off your shoulders give up and do whats right for you give up and make the right decision about your health give up and love the people around you even if they hurt you give up because we will all die anyway just give up because nothing is that serious to worry about enjoy what you are right now sink in to what you are because the more you deny it the more your denying life i feel the urge to try to find something to take away the issues i have but I then realize the issue was i wasnt seeing what was infront of me there is nothing more to it only what is infront of you ,i hope everyone reading this finds themselves in there body fully alive fully breathing and feeling dont ever suppress yourself for anything if something is too painful to think about just remember to breathe and understand that fighting it will cause you more pain instead of just dealing with it,it's like when i was in school I procrastinated on the homework i had and didnt deal with it but when i did the feeling of the wieght off my shoulders. I dont feel though that you should give up on life just dont always feel like you need to fix something be fully in yourself what ever you truely need to deal with will pop up and then you will realizd that you are just looking at the problem the problem is there but its not doing anything to your body your just looking at it trust that its there let it say what it needs let it apologize to you even but then give it up.I love you guys i hope giving up makes you realize there was nothing to truely give up your just simply there bye :)
