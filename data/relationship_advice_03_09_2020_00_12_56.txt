I posted here because of unrequited love, but this is what I am living as of today. I am unable to have a relationship with someone because of my immigration status and it’s driving me insane, literally. I don’t feel wanted, desired, or valued. I feel extremely undatable due to the recurrent rejections.                                                              Sounds crazy right?! But it has happened to me, ever since I started dating in the city I currently live in.                                                                              How can I handle this situation better?! I want people to see beyond that (maybe my stakes are too high). As soon as they know, they run to the hills as fast as they can - I mostly encounter men that think this way.                                                              Everybody tells me that the best is yet to come, but I don’t think so, especially with what I carry. I do believe it takes a brave, confident men to even want to give it a go.                                                         I feel for anyone going through rejection. Whatever advice you have is welcome, thanks!
