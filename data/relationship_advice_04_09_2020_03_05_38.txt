I’m 20 & gay in college and I’ve been with my boyfriend since last May but in October we had gone to price together and it was my first experience at pride which was really amazing until it got ruined when we were stopped at our college on the way home. He had to go see a class mate and I waited in his car and he forgot his phone and we’re very open with our devices with each other and I didn’t feel a need to search I trusted him very much so I had gone to send myself all the pictures we took together on his phone when he got a text from an unlisted contact asking when he’d be home. I read the convo and had my heart shattered when I saw he had hooked up with him sent nudes & everything just a week before. I confronted him when he was back and he just kept saying he loves me and that it was a mistake and an accident and based off the texts it got far enough with whoever this was that they physically were at his apartment yet he claims he backed out last minute but I can’t believe that due to one text saying “you were fun” and another asking about a threesome sometime to which he replied “ooooooo” (if he backed out why wouldn’t he shut that down?) it’s been months now and I just kinda tried to move on and work past it staying with him stupidly and I’m still with him and there’s been instances the last few months where I catch him on grindr or something like that and I just feel apathetic to it. I love him still I do lots but I just feel so uncared for and overall apathetic to everything now. When I try and bring it up he gets panic attacks or so he claims which leaves me feeling like I can’t even talk about things in relation to what he did to me and I just feel kinda trapped. I know I should leave him I just don’t know how to and even though I know I really need to I don’t want to either. I just feel so lost and betrayed. If anyone needs more details I have so many I can provide I just wanna see what somebody has to say from the outside :((
