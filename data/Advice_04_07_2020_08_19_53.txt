So I really need advice. We bought a house last summer two weeks before I gave birth so we was really in a hurry to purchase something and had no problem with minor repairs etc. but what we didn’t bargain for was an abandoned house across the street. Literally the first week we were moved in me and my mom, my husband, and our neighbor who is also the blocks “enforcer” idk (not code enforcer but similar) were all chatting outside and seen two men arrive across the street. So we all go to introduce ourselves and ask if they’re gonna fix the place up. This “house” is actually a double wide on concrete foundation. The yard is completely grown up (Like literal trees sprouting everywhere and are already thick). They tell us about how he bought some store and the previous owners threw in this house just to get rid of it. Apparently these two men had put a roof on it 2-3 years prior to us meeting ( btw it’s already junk). That’s all they got done. Almost all the windows are busted, the back sliding doors are shattered. The roof is starting to warp, the house is almost completely gutted and moldy inside. It’s a total tear down if you ask me. So after speaking with these men we gathered that they were supposedly going to be back to get the place cleaned up and renovated.. whatever. Just under one year has now gone by and we have NEVER seen those men again. No one has tried to clean the yard, no repairs have been made to the house. Etc. so here’s where things get even more frustrating.. there are squatters in and out alllll the time. I’ve caught kids destroying it and climbing on the roof before as well. It’s a freaking hot spot let me tell you. There’s vehicles that drive by real slow all the time ..the door can be shut for days and then will be all the sudden open and then shut again. (We have checked to make sure the door catches and stays closed and it does. We could lock it but they can just go in the back since the doors are shattered and open it again so what’s the point.) so I guess what I’m wanting advice about is what in the world would y’all do? Would y’all try to sue for devaluing our property? Would you sue for all the scares? Would you sue for it being a damn eye sore?? Can you even sue? Lol Wtf can we have done about this stupid house? I’ll post a pic if I can of how bad it is already just in April! It gets sooo bad mid summer. The brush gets sooo thick. I’m terrified of snakes being in it and crossing the street to our yard. I’m terrified of the people squatting and if they are watching my house. I’m terrified that the wrong person is in there and has bad intentions. This house is a nuisance and it needs to gooooooo. 😩 we just don’t know what to do.. neighbors have already tried contacting them, the city has tried. They just don’t gaf. I heard there’s a law that if you clean/remodel an abandoned property then you own it if you have proof of cleaning/remodeling! Lol so that’s interesting.
