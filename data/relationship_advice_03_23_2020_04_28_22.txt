So I (14M) know that one of my friend has been dating this girl ,who apparently said that she was 13, for a few months now and I thought that is was all cool and fun as this was their first relationship and I was excited for them.                                                                 But then fast foward a few months it turned out the girl was only 12 and I was kinda nervous because I didn't know if it was legal or not but I let it slide and didn't think too much of it. And then fast foward a month or 2 later (A few days ago) they had an argument and broke up.                                                                                                 Well it turns out that the girl had been sending nudes to my friend and he still has it saved on his phone and the creepy thing is that he is not planning to delete them and one of my other friend (14M) has even asked to see it. Even though he said it in a not serious tone as we were messing around it was still kinda creepy and I tried to keep my cool but I didn't know what to do on the inside. I even asked him to delete it but he said 'does it look like I care?' Now don't get me wrong this guy is a really nice and cool guy but I guess it's his first relationship and we all make mistakes but this is  serious and I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is legal or not                                                                                 Any advice is highly appreciated.                                                                                       For context I live in Australia, Thanks
