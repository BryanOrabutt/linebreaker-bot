Hi. I met this beautiful person over a year ago. We love each other just so much. I am his first relationship ever, and he is 41. He told me early on, how he never got to have any much sexual experience and feels like he missed out. Which I understand, as I had a 14 relationship before where I met my partner with 18 and I felt the same way. After we broke up I got my experiences and I needed them to be at the stage where I am now! And this is, my new partner is all I want and need. So I understand my partner that he feels that way. But there is the problem, Its eating me up to know that I am not enough and he wants to sleep with others. Even though he said he doesn't want to lose me or hurt me. He doesn't want to do it as such, but he can't guarantee. And if he really wants to do it in the future he would tell me before! And then it would also only be sex, as he only wants to be with me I am his solemate he thinks i am sexy and all. He is just the most honest person I know and is not shady at all, just a loving big bear who never got much sexual experience. Its terrible to know that your partner wants sex with others. I talked to friends and many said that many guys who are married want to sleep with others but never do it as they love there partners. Can I get your openings on this please! I am the most happy and the most depressed since I am with him. I do think we are meant to be, as our love and chemistry is so great. He might never do it! And he is so honest,this must count for something!? Also it would be just sex. He knows how sad it makes me but at the same time it's not his fold either. We both are victims here I feel. Is really would prefer to hear from people who where or are in similar situations. Or do you feel like cheating but never do it as you love your partner to great? Is it right to have this in a relationship? I am just very confused please help me. Many thanks!
