So basically I know this kid who we will call "james" even though I could give less than a fuck about his identity, but let's just say this kid backstabbed me and manipulated my younger sister, so we've gotten into alot of arguments before and we were play fighting and I kicked him in the balls by mistake I told him it was a mistake and still didnt forgive me just BAM! A 7 year friend ship gone, but we became friends again and sidenote (he actually came over and lived here sometimes because of my aunt and the first few times and he was a nice kid and quite enjoyable but later in life he would start ghosting me and my sister for his tablet to talk with friends. Literally while we're sitting there talking. Fast forward and my dad dies after a brain aneurysm and pneumonia battle and he shows up at the funeral and I start liking the kid alot again no homo of course, but he comes there and leaves again but then I get a text responding to the incident about me kicking him in the balls that basically says, FUCK YOU WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS, and I respond saying you know that was months ago right? And I say if you didnt pretend you were tough enough to hold metal next to a shooting flame thrower than I wouldve went easier (btw im not justifying my actions) but we eventually talk about my dad and he says he only went to the funeral because he was forced to go which means he didnt wanna support me and my family who were nicer to him than his actual family usually is to him but he was also a fake friend, so fast forward to Christmas the fucko moves in to the house that I live in (its a 2 apartment house) and he keeps trying to lock me out of the house and apologizing to me and the sad part is my mom tells my sister his sob story and my sister's dumbass becomes his friend again even though I showed her the text messages of him saying and I quote "I dont need you or your sister" so now that he's living in new Jersey with no friends he has to manipulate my sister by becoming her friend because he has none anymore I swear shes gonna get controlled one day and I'm not gonna be therr to save her because she thinks shes being kind but shes being someones puppet ðŸ˜¤.
