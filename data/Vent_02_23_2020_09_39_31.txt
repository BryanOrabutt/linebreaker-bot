I know im totally out of line feeling mad about this but, whatever.. I met my friend on Instagram a couple years ago weve been good friends ever since we mostly bonded over being really really awkward and like just mentally ill lol. We aren’t awkward together on text but I basically dread having to voice call him because he makes things as awkward as possible. Im no stranger to making others feel awkward but ive actually made a huge effort to improve and ive been getting a little better especially compared to a couple years ago. Talking to him on vc is so hard he never asks questions so im basically trying to get him to talk about himself the whole time he never tries to actually discuss things with me either.. ill bring up something we can debate or discuss in more detail and hell just cut it off with an idk. I mean. You would know if you gave it some thought i know you would why would you cut short like that. And the thing is he’s constantly telling me that hes so awkward and that he cant get better it’s basically a fucking pity party YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE I MEAN LIKE.. ITS NOT JUST GOING TO FUCKING COME ITS A CONSCIOUS EFFORT YOU HAVE TO TRY. It just pisses me the fuck off when people just act like something you can change with time and consistent effort is set in stone and can never be changed so why even try. I actually couldnt hold a conversation with someone at all a couple years ago but ive been making an effort ive been trying AND IM IMPROVING IT WORKS IT LITERALLY WORKS YOU JUST NEED TO TRY IM SICK OF FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF AND IM SICK OF OTHERS FEELING LIKE THAT TOO LIKE I KNOW ITS DIFFERENT FOR EVERY PERSON BUT WHEN YOU MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT BUT STILL COMPLAIN ITS LIKE... REALLY??? DO YOU ACTUALLY WANNA GET BETTER????? Of course i cant tell him this he calls me a ‘neurotypical’ which is literally not true and so fucking insulting to me because IM LIKE LITERALLY FUCKING CRIPPLINGLY MENTALLY ILL YOU CANT JUST TELL ME MY POINTS ARE INVALID BECAUSE IM A ‘neurotypical’ whatever whatever.. am i ok in feeling mad.. like have any of you guys gone through something similar also.. i really ranted sorry
