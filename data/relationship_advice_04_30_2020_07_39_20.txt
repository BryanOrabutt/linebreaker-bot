We was on a break last month. She told me she wanted a break and she didn’t know what she wanted to do, she didn’t know if she love me, she didn’t feel like herself. I fought with her about it but eventually said okay. My moms boyfriend die in my house so it made everything worse. When we was on a break everything hurt like everything fall apart. I been depressed before and I was feeling it slowly crawling back. She didn’t comfort me at all she didn’t cancel the break. I even told her I needed her rn. All she did was tell me to relax and calm down. She said we were on a break we’re not together rn. I started talking to other females to keep my mind off of her cuz she’s all that I think about. I sent pics and videos not gonna lie. She finally wanted to get back with me and found out the same day we met up that I was talking to other females. I never cheated on her. She was disappointed and mad. I didn’t let her see my phone cuz of the stuff that was said. Eventually she dropped it and I blocked the girls I was talking to. She gave me a deal that to make a new fb and a new ig account and give her the passwords. I did that. Everything felt normal a little bit. Around Saturday she told me she wasn’t happy still. I told her to think and I’ll give her some space if she wants. Sunday comes she tells me we shouldn’t be together because she keeps thinking of the mistake I made. I’ve done everything for her literally. Gave her the best valentines day cuz she never had one, helped her out even when she didn’t need it, she told me that to not wait for her. Also she said that she can’t be in a relationship with me rn and that maybe in the future we’ll be together. We both love each other. She said we can be close friends and still hangout and all but things would be different. I’m just hurt I need to vent I need to rant. I apologize several times and wrote her essays and everything. It still didn’t help. I haven’t ate I haven’t drinked. All I do is sleep. Everything hurts.
