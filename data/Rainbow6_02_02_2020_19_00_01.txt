So the latest statistics on pick and win rates for defenders was released a little while ago and Jäger is at a 90% pick rate with about a 0.85% win delta. His gun is great, his gadget is very useful, and he is a 3 speed op, so it’s understandable why he is chosen so much. However, I have a couple of potential ideas on how Ubi could change him to lower his pick rate significantly. The first being a few small changes to his 416-C. This weapon has had a quite a few minor changes throughout the past 4 years from losing the ACOG to the most recent of changes being lowering the damage from 42 to 38, so the only thing I could think of is to raise the recoil and/or lower the fire rate a considerable amount. That isn’t the only option though. The second thing I can think of is to change how the ADS reacts to projectiles being fired out of launchers. Let’s be honest here, no matter how great Jäger made the Magpie ADS it would not be able to shoot projectiles out of the air the second they are fired from a Launcher. So I think Ubisoft should add anywhere between a 0.5 to a 1 second delay feature to the ADS where it first has to track the projectile and then it can shoot it out of the air. (This would be the case for Zofia’s Concussions and Impacts, Ash’s Breaching Rounds, Nomad’s Air Jabs, and Kali’s Javelins) However the rest of the things the ADS can destroy, (Thatcher’s EMP, Ying’s Candelas, Fuze’s Cluster Charge, Flashes, Frags, and Smokes) will take the current amount of time, as they are moving much slower and would be seen sooner by the Magpie’s detection system. If for whatever reason that would prove to much of a challenge to implement, Ubi could just remove one of his ADS’s so he only has two. The final change has to do with his Armor and Speed ratings. A lot of people use Jäger to roam and that has to do with the fact that he is a 3 speed operator so of Ubisoft were to change him to be a 2 speed 2 armor this would definitely lower his pick rate significantly.
