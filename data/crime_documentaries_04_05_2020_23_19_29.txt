I’m gonna try to make this short, so I’m trying to find out what documentary this is. one time a couple years ago I remember watching this documentary that was probably made around the time of The Case of Jon Benet Ramsey, which I remember also watching around that same time period. And it was about like this guy and his wife or girlfriend, I think they were around their twenties at the time and in the documentary filming the wife was like around her 60s it looked like, but I really don’t know or remeber so the crime probably took place around the late 70s to early to mid 90s maybe. And the man and wife went to like they’re friends house, which was 2 other men, and they ended up just like shooting the husband/boyfriend(don’t know if they were married) and then they like forced the wife whatever into like a trunk like chest or box in the basement and locked her into it. And then I think like she somehow escaped maybe like a couple of days later or maybe even the same night as the incident and ran to the closest house and like hid in the bushes at night time because the two men were I think looking for her, and then police cams blah blah blah and I think the two men like cut the husband with a saw into multiple pieces and like put them into this little like river or pond at the house. And so the husband obviously was dead and the dad of the husband was like saying how one of the men was like a childhood friend and use to always come too ok their house and they would do so much for him and then the dad went to court for their hearing or trial or whatever and he was saying how he wanted or was going to bring a revolver or handgun to shoot one of them and he wouldn’t go out without a fight and like I remeber the wife, who was older now, and the dad like just crying and I feel like I remeber the dad saying a quote like ,”all I remeber seeing was just a picture of his head floating in the water” or something along Those  lines. Now remember this is all of my memory from this documentary which was probably made in or around 2016. And sorry I’m advance for this long as fucking and paragraph but thank you if you read it all and especially if you could give me the name of anyone or anything related to this crime or documentary.
