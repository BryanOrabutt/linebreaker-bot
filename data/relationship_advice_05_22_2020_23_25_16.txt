I recently broke up with my gf (21f) of a year. This was my first relationship. This was for a variety of reasons, but I think the primary reason I chose to break up with her was because her parents treated me horribly. I don't try at much in life, but I really wanted this relationship to work, so I tried really hard to have a good relationship with her parents. I would tell them whenever we would go out, try to bring her back by her curfew, drop her off home, etc. I think a big problem they had with me was my race. My gf is asian whereas I am brown. They wouldn't say anything to my face, but they would say things alot of things behind my back. How I was unattractive, not very smart, there would be better guys, etc. I typically don't pay heed to stuff like this. I don't like concerning myself with the opinions of others, but this felt different. I tried so hard to have a good relationship with her parents but they would just say these things behind my back. It just crushed my self-esteem and my view of relationships. My close friends tried to offer some support and deny the things her parents said but those thoughts still linger. I ended up taking up my frustration and anger onto her, which was definitely not right. I realized how I was behaving and realized it was better to just end it than hurt my gf anymore. I don't think I was the perfect partner but I just feel demoralized by this relationship. I was getting ostracized for being born a certain color. What if the parents of any other girl i try to date treat me the same way. What if they just see my brown skin and assume certain things about me. They refuse to even acknowledge me as a bf just because they think this won't last. I don't want to deal with that anymore. I don't think I have done anything to deserve this treatment and yet I feel like not pursuing anymore relationships would be the best path for me. I don't like this thinking and would like to hear any advice. Thank you!
