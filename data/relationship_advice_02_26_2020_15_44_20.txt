So my boyfriend usually buys a lot of stuff for himself. He wastes a lot of money on things like a custom made Xbox controller, video games and now he wants to buy AirPods pro which is pretty freaking expensive. Now when it comes to me he kind of avoids buying presents. He first bought me a pair of earrings, which I haven't used in a while, like the first month of us dating. A Christmas gift. Then after that, he paid for a Vday gift which I don't remember exactly what it was now, a pearl necklace and tickets to movies, amusement park tickets which were also expensive but not like Airpods expensive. But he kind of stopped. The other day he bought us movie tickets but it was a gift card he got from a family member. We had this fight once, he denies it, but I swear that it started because I asked him why we don't go out to dinner more often. He also this one time told me that he needed to save money, but a few days later was planning on eating out with friends. For our one year anniversary, I had plans to buy him dinner at an expensive restaurant and after that buy us dessert at a jazz club which he loves. But we had a fight and ended up not doing my plans but later on we did his. Which was a pizza buffet at a shopping mall and later on watch the lion king. I can't help but feel like I put more effort? We took a break to concentrate in school for a week and had to postpone V day this year. But said we would celebrate when we had more time. But most of the time his plans revolve around being at his place and buying a pizza at the supermarket or buying McDonalds and staying in his room. And when we do the same things he complains about our relationship being stale and us having routines but whenever I ask him to eat out or something he "needs to save money". I can't help but feel like he doesn't care anymore? Or that he doesn't think I deserve it. I've tried talking to him before but as said, we ended up fighting. Should I move on? Or should I try talking again?
