So I found out my toxic abusive narcissistic dad read my journal which had extremely private stuff in it that no one had any business knowing and it was a goal and how I plan to achieve that goal and he decided to disclose it to my cousin, older brother and entire family and extended family uncles aunts, and basically ripped it out and showed it to the world and at a restaurant where my mom brother and dad who are all narcissistic and my cousin were at, my brother said a very subtle thing like a joke making fun of and mocking my dream in a subtle way a subtle jokish way which caused me to feel shame humiliation and anger and embarrassment and my dad and brother felt happy and pleasured from it and didn’t care felt no remorse or guilt for it and my face went red and my brother got happy and pleasure from it and it attacked my self esteem and confidence and made me feel less significant and big and I left to go to the restroom to immediately get help from reddit in a stall but also because I had to go poop and while I left I heard my brother laughing as I left the table. Also by ripping my journal out and showing it to the world basically my dad has ruined my life because I feel ashamed and embarrassed of my awesome goals and stuff that I used to feel awesome about I don’t feel awesome about it anymore and he knows this and is happy from it and feels absolutely no remorse or guilt for it maybe my mom but not my brother or dad and everyone who sat there and listened to my dad didn’t reprimand or scold him for what he did and didn’t really care so I think that says something about them as well. But anyway can anyone offer me some advice? Also I’ve been undereating for the past 3 months and my whole family doesn’t care and is happy I’ve been so and losing muscles when I used to be more muscular(I’m 16 male btw) And my narcissistic brother who’s 18 has access to all my emails and email passwords and passwords that are stored on those email accounts so he access to everything else all other apps on my phone and also strangely the photos on my phone and has it so that through my iPhone XR camera and microphone he can see where I am  and what what I’m saying and or doing and I don’t know how to get him to stop. He seems pretty confident he’ll never get caught and it can just stay this way for the rest of my life on earth which is bad but he has a point because I tell this to the police and they say what? This has been causing me so much stress I look 5 million when I’m only 16 and my parents don’t care this is happening to me(obviously) and are glad it is. Also my dad took away extremely private papers of mine that I wrote down extremely private stuff which is my whole future plan and all my dreams and also I forgot to mention that after he read they stuff and goals in my journal he’s been sabotaging those goals ever since and me accomplishing those goals and I feel less confident to achieve them and he’s been sabotaging and trying to sabotage those extremely private goals he read in that journal and he also found out my goal of being emancipated and trying to sabotage that as well by saying these subtle subliminal messages indicating that it’ll never happen and so those extremely private papers with my future and goals and dreams on it he took is concerning me because he’s been trying to sabotage me about those as well and he won’t give it back no matter what even when I took his phone and I told him if he gives the papers back I’ll give the phone back he still wouldn’t give it back and continually lied and denied and would rather have called the police to get the phone back than give the papers back which is ridiculous and is a testament to how much he wants to sabotage and ruin my path of success and life and so I gave the phone back but he still hasn’t given the papers back to this day and he said he’s condemned to hell if he took them which infuriated me beyond words because he knows he’s not condemned to hell for taking those papers he’s saying it like trying to distract me or as some kind of diversion that he took it away. Some kind of diversion and that’s why he said it but he knows he’s not condemned to hell for taking those papers. He still has them and I hope he gives them back. Also I don’t know what to do if every title I want to eat enough my whole family just says stuff like “You’re eating too much” when they know I’m not and they know I’m undereating just to get me to eat too little and prevent me from eating enough. What can I do? Please help me.
