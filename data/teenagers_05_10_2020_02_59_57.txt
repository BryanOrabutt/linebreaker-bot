 \- What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I'm OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You'll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?     We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We're all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it's just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan't breathe.
