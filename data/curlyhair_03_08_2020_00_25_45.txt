I never usually post on social, but I had something positive to share with you guys. I’m so happy with my decision 18 months ago to cut off 14 inches of my chemically straightened hair to help cultivate it back to its original curly-ness! It took me 30 years to be comfortable enough to be able to do this, so for me it was a big deal! I’m thankful for my Greek-Cypriot heritage that gave me natural bouncy locks, I’ll never try to hide them again! Having burnt and ironed and chemically altered my hair for 15 years, I was so desperate to fit in with the British girls at my school, and later in life was told as a young graduate in fashion retail by management that “I shouldn’t come into work without straightening my hair”, the weight of the burden to conform was large. But this decision to go back to my curly roots finally enabled me to discover who I really am, physically and mentally. Sounds extreme but it’s true 🙏 it also encouraged me to embrace bringing more natural into my life so I stopped wearing make-up full-time. It’s super hard at first, felt kind of anxious and awkward seeing my friends or going to meetings for the first time without it, felt that I look like a child or a boy, but ultimately, no decent person is ever going to judge you for not looking a certain way or conforming to pressure, even if we understand that pressure is subconscious (trying to fit in, upbringing, social media etc.) it’s very hard to break out of. For me it was a real penny drop moment, discovering that most people are humans who do not immediately place a value on you so they can assess how important you are to the conversation in the first five seconds based on how you look. No. Decent humans don’t do that. And once more people have that penny drop moment and realise that you can be who you are and people will still love you, we will all start to feel a little bit happier. It is only a little bit, but it’s the start for anyone who wants to live an authentic life, powered by understanding and intuition, not by shame or fear. I love growing up and getting older if this is the kind of stuff I get to figure out 👊 Lesson number 1# be grateful for being YOU, unapologetically and authentically YOU. Cos you’re awesome and everyone knows it.
