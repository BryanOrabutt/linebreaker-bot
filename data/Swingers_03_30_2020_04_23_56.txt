Me and my husband have been together almost 14 years now.  We are very secure in our relationship, and have had several threesomes- without issues. While we have never swapped or even had same room sex as another couple- our third was always single.  Recently we were having a few drinks with another couple and things developed into a same room sex - with our own partners and me and his wife messing around. Well the next night- she asked if we would consider a full same room swap, and talked with hubby and we all agreed to go forward with it and laid out our rules.    Everything was great. I was worried there might be insecurities but nothing. Everyone was great, including me. Fast forward, the very next weekend we get together with the understanding itâ€™s going to happen again, except one of our husbands asked for separate rooms- for his own reasons, that everyone respected and agreed with.  Great night- we all piled into bed together when we finished separately- and woke up amazing again.    Now when me and my husband get home, we shower and go about business- until that evening when we go to have sex with each other - I notice he is all scratched up . His chest, stomach, back- everything is marked and immediately I feel a ball in my chest of anger. I donâ€™t know Like the idea of him performing sexual acts with her turns me on- but her digging into him just keeps nagging at me.  Seeing these marks bothered me and has for the past few days.  Is this weird? I keep trying to understand why it bothers me so I can address it- but the only thing I imagine is me being possessive. I told him it bothers me, but I canâ€™t understand why, heâ€™s willing to never see them again. But I want to- can one of my rules be not to mark my husband? ðŸ˜‚ I feel so petty and childish, something in my head so small  in comparison to sexual acts. Iâ€™ve just never done this and need a little insight from more experienced people. Or even just another perspective. Or ideas on how I can deal with it on my own so it doesnâ€™t make waves- because I really enjoy our arrangement outside of this one detail.
