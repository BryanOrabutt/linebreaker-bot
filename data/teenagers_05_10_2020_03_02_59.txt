 \- You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It's got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.     - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don't freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?     Don't move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one's flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.     Where's the pilot?     He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who's that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It's got giant wings, huge engines.     I can't fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That's Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!
