The title says it all idk if I need help or what my life has been nothing but a absolute joke since I was born I was born asthmatic almost died so many times up tell I was about 16 I was in and out of the hospital a good 7-14 times a year depending on if lungs felt like being nice... with that being done I was robbed of a education my last type of any form of schooling was the second grade no ged no job atm nothing I got nothing going on when I turned 18 my mom got breast cancer and I stoped working when I turned 19 to finally take care of her while developing a meth addiction that lasted from 17-20 I met my wife after I got sober and we have been married since July 31st if 2019 I need help it seems that nothing I do will ever work or be able to catch up in life how many people can say the person the love and you are forced to live with your mother while your spouse works cause I don’t have good quality’s for work not using this as a excuse but it’s hard finding a job that will hire someone uneducated unless it’s work I physically can not preform cause of my own health issues the only job I had that I was some what decent at was a butcher but I fucked that up cause of my drug addiction I’m so worried and scared it’s not like I don’t try I’m so poor and unsure what to do every day I wanna kill myself just a bit more sure my wife makes just enough to pay our bills and what not but it’s no way to live.. my own mistakes cost close to 3000 in fines and court cost cause I tried my luck shop lifting and making me feel more like a loser she pays for them I don’t like it I would rather go to jail for however long to pay my debt to the state back I’m really scared by the time someone reads this I’ll be dead this is kinda like a suicide note I don’t know if I’ll finally go through with it this time but I got enough fentanyl to make a bear die and my mind is racing as I write this in the bathroom no I’m not high yet and I’m trying not to I’m so lost and feel like any chance I possibly have in life is gone I don’t know what to do for a education I tried to go to ged classes but they did understand that I never got any kind of education past a second grade level and have no idea what to do I can’t be the only one in the world struggling with a issue similar I just feel like a burden to this world and I’m ready for it to end I’m in so much pain and I hate it I’m having to watch my mom die froM a horrible illness while she lets me and my wife live with her yes we both take care of her maybe it’s a blessing in reality my wife and me starve cause we all agreed that as adults me and her will worry about our own food I try to be responsible but I can’t even support my wife and I feel like she’s slowly growing hate towards me I don’t know what to do and I need help I’m not killing my self tonight after writing this vent I feel more calm but definitely need advice and no I refuse to go to any mental hospitals or anything they do not help I have been to 4 and all they did was lock me up and starve me of nicotine and drug me up with pills that made me just sleep for 14-17 hours at a time
