The slate isn't perfect - everyone knows that.  But, when you buy one you expect to be getting a brand new device that works perfectly as intended.  If it doesn't, then you would expect a company like google to send you something that does and a new one like you paid for.  That is the opposite of what the actually do though.  Long story short - I have had the worst customer service experience that I've ever had in my life thanks to Google.  They know the slate is a messed up machine with a lot of issues and many people having the same problems.  Instead of making up for these defects, they argue with you and pass you along to other people and make it impossible to have an issue resolved how it should be.  I got sick of it all and the support actually got me to the point where I just wanted to get rid of my slate right away.  I couldn't even stand looking at it let alone using it anymore knowing I paid Google so much money to have it.  I took it to the local pawn shop and sold it for cheap and I feel a million times better.  I went to Walmart to get a cheap Chromebook for the meantime and it works way better and way faster than the slate did! And it was only $175 15" screen and everything.  I have the pixel 4xl and the new pixel buds and Google home everything x 10 and just about every Google product you could think of.  I used to like the company and where they were going.  Now I can't even stand the thought of them.  Not only did I get rid of my slate, but they lost a really big customer who paid them a lot of money every year - just to try to save a couple dollars and not make a situation right.   I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Google really could take over - if they weren't so terrible along the way.  They're only going to go down from here because of how they treat their customers.
