So, I have been without a job for a long time. My husband and I have been having some financial difficulties. We were actually homeless for about 3 months. We just now started getting back on our feet, a friend found out we were homeless living in our car and decided we could stay on the couch until we found a place of our own. My husband just started his new job about two weeks ago, and was supposed to get his first paycheck this morning. I started my new job yesterday. We only have one vehicle so we have to share it. There is $0 in our account we have no assets nothing to pawn nothing to sell. My husband is making significantly more than I am and is full-time while I am part time. We fully expected for his check to deposit in our account this morning but here it is 8 and nothing. The issue is are gas light is on. I was supposed to be at work at 5 this morning. He does not go in till 9. This morning when I woke up to get ready for work I checked the account in there was still nothing. I woke up my husband and talk to him. We found all the change we could find  and scrounge up $4 . My job is further away than his job.  So we only have enough gas for one person to go to work. We decided that it would be best for him to go to work today because he makes more and is full-time. We need his job more than we need mine at this point. I am so embarrassed that I have no family or friends to help me out I can't ask for a ride or a loan. I went ahead and sent my job an email explaining the situation, I explained to them how sorry I was for any inconvenience that I may have caused. They haven't emailed back and I'm scared I will lose this job because of this. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so lost I'm 25 and we can't seem to get out of this rut we have gotten ourselves into. I feel completely hopeless
