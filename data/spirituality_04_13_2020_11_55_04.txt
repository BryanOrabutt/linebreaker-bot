So this dream takes place in my grandparents room,(I live with them) I go in there all excited cuz the next day is July 14th 4 days before my birthday (44 have any significance? Who knows) my grandpa says idk why that's exciting cuz you'll still have 4 days until your birthday, I sorta ignored him in the dream, he then asks me to from what I heard to grap him a water and a soda, I agree, then I get into a long conversation (that I don't remember) and then I go to leave the room but before I leave I ask my grandpa if it was water and soda he says no aggressively gets up and goes to the kitchen all while acting snarky towards me and he gets a coffee and goes back to his room, I then get into a heated rant with my grandma about how he disrespected me and bla bla bla (my home every respect oriented, I respect them they respect me anyone who crosses the line gets put in their place) I go to bed, wake up the next day this is now July 14th as I suppose there's significance in the dream about this day, I get up and head to the garage to work out, then I see a group of woman going into my house, I go inside cuz they look familiar, while in there over time the house is getting more and more pact with woman, all of which I've had previous dreams with, like all the imaginary girls I've ever seen in my history of dreams showed up to celebrate my early bday, a few I remember from my irl school, but most were from previous dreams in which I had friendships or relationships with in previous dreams, some were just one time stands in dreams, but a lot that I don't really know irl, my grandma for some reason goes over to some girls to lie and say that I love them idk why, but then she came back and sat down and I was like you told them it was a joke right? She just says they didn't believe here, and so I'm sitting there how I normally am awkward and quiet, then one girl who holds more significance than the others show up, she has a more edgy like style, egirl possibly, but she gifts me a mug with my name on it, which I find interesting since words in dreams are normally incomprehensible but I could clearly see it was my name but spelled weird like {W} tttyyyllleeerrr t?t that was what was written on the back in very small letters, but the front just had my name spelled normally on the cup, I say thank you she smiles and walks away after she walks away I start to remember who she was, she was a past relationship I had in which we grew very very close, very open with each other and stuff, i can only guess it was a dream relationship cuz idk her irl, but I was feeling a bunch of emotions, my heart was pounding a little fast, after that I woke up and my heart was still pounding a little fast, I look at the clock and its 7:11 been seeing 11 a lot lately, idk if this dream has any significance or is just a random dream, these dreams are my typical dreams but this one feels different. Also all my dreams are very vivid and I normally end up remembering almost the entire dream, I consider that a blessing.
