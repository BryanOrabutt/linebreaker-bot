    > Remember the [Chinese girl from the Oxford debate?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHLTew86v48&t=4s) Well, her name is [Anastalia Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Lin). Her father amassed a fortune in China and after her parents decoupled from China, she built her persona by highlighting the human rights violations the CCP has done and raising awareness of Falun Gong in Canada while becoming Miss World Canada (whatever that means). Read her biography carefully and watch the debate, read the comments, and you will understand she should not be speaking on behalf of Chinese-Canadians. Caucasians see the Chinese language in support of her but there are clearly ties to Falun Gong. This morning, Sam Cooper, from Global News, posted an article titled [Chinese-Canadians ‘suffering in silence’ as China’s United Front reaches into Canada.](https://twitter.com/scoopercooper/status/1260164468245495808) Sam uses Anastasia Lin's speech as an example of how we as Chinese-Canadians are being infiltrated by the [United Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front). Sam continues to push anti-chinese content through Twitter/Global News and has a history of making [accusations against small business owners in Vancouver without any evidence](http://www.theprovince.com/business/follow+money+evidence+submitted+fraud+probe+points+concerns+about+vancouver+real+estate/11683456/story.html) (of course to those only with Chinese surnames). Now he is claiming that people like us are being influenced/told how to act by the CCP. However as someone who is born in Vancouver with Chinese parents who immigrated  in 1996, I completely disagree with this. My family has no ties to CCP and I have not been told how to think by the UnItEd FrOnT. In fact, I feel like people like Sam Cooper and Anastasia Lin are trying to manipulate Canadians into thinking people like us are pawns of the CCP. [Sams other article](https://twitter.com/scoopercooper/status/1255828203333193729) also has some wild claims that I would like to discuss about, but for this post, I want to focus on addressing one thing to Chinese Canadians here. My family (age 50~) and their friends are all Canadian citizens with businesses and careers here and we are all noticing a spike in racism against Chinese during the Covid19 outbreak by locals. We wonder why Global news is spending resources and time trying to tell Chinese Canadians that we are under threat by the United Front and not the racist crimes that are happening to us. What is the motive of people like Sam Cooper? When my parents friends are starting to be worried about biased journalism like this and increasing mccarthyism I believe we need to start taking action. Sam claims [Anastasia is speaking up for all Chinese Canadians in his tweet](https://twitter.com/scoopercooper/status/1260238814334902277) but I dont believe this to be true. Can we Chinese Canadians get something going? If Sam continues to make claims like these and Global News reports this as news, there needs to be consequences for his actions. This is absolute dogshit journalism.
