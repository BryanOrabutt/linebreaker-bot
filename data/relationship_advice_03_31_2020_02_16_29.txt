My boyfriend of 1 year and I decided to quarantine together. My state is under a mandatory stay at home quarantine where we cannot leave the house whatsoever. So, I decided that going to my boyfriends house for the quarantine would be the best option out of either staying at my parents’ or his house. He has a very high paying government job that has been deemed non-essential, meaning he is off work until about April 30th. He’s been off for about 2 weeks.. and all he is doing is playing video games. Normally, he only plays his video games on the weekend. However, due to quarantine he is almost on his game 12-16 hours out of a 24 hour day. He is gaining weight, does not like to go outside and walk with me everyday to get some sunshine, and complains when I want to do something other than sit in the room all day. I try to keep busy- I have set a desk up in his guest bedroom to do my remote online school work at, and for me to come in here to give each other some space. I’m really trying to understand that he is off work and video games are his favorite thing to do. So I’m not getting mad at him or angry.. I am giving him his space and just figured he will get tired of his game eventually. But it truly seems like the only time he is happy is when he is on his game with his friends. He is not doing anything else to better himself during this quarantine except sit at his desk and eat food. It’s very frustrating and I don’t know what else to do with him because I’m such an active person. I like to walk, go for runs, hike, and be outside and enjoy nature. He also has a really bad issue of keeping his phone in his hand 24/7 constantly messaging his friends about when he will be on the game next. It’s really hard for me when I want to hangout with him or have some time outside with him.. I just need some insight on what I should do or if I should even do anything at all.
