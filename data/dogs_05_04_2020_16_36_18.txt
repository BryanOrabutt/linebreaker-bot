\*\*Introduction\*\* Hi everyone. My husband and I are in the research phase of getting a second dog, and we'd love some more opinions and advice about breeds.  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* No, we have one dog already, a mixed breed rescue called Bobby who we've had for 2 years. He's naturally pretty chill but we've trained him all the basics and a couple of simple tricks.  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  \* We've got our hearts set on a puppy so almost certainly a breeder.  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* We want a dog who will have a good bond with us, who likes to spend time with us going out walking and jogging in the countryside. We'd like a dog who is friendly with other dogs and humans, and gentle with children (as human babies are hopefully in our future too!)  4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* It sounds a bit odd but our main criteria are that the dog is at least as big (preferably bigger) than Bobby (who is \~35lb) and not too hairy! We like labradors, English springer spaniels or even a Vizsla.   5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* To run with us, to fetch and play with toys, and any other more breed-specific training like agility as appropriate.  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* Not particularly! But if the dog really took to a particular discipline we'd be up for pursuing it! \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* 2-3 hours most weekdays, longer on weekends.  8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* An hour or two every day, longer on weekends and holidays. At present we take Bobby out 3x a day for walks, and there are ample opportunities for running around and playing on our walks, as we're lucky to live in the countryside.  9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Happy to brush about once a week, and do necessary grooming at home.  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* >35 lb  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Shedding up to the sort of labrador level, not too much barking and minimal slobber!  12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Very important.  \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Snuggly, but it's ok if this isn't all the time!  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* More eager-to-please.  15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Like our current dog - barks if he's out in the yard and someone comes past. Once introduced to people happy to go up for pets and attention!  16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No.  17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Overly fearful of other dogs. Strong drive to chase livestock.  \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* For about 2 hours each weekday afternoon.  19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* My husband likes bigger dogs and he prefers short-haired breeds. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* One other dog, as mentioned, and a pond full of goldfish!  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Not initially, but the family might grow in future!  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* N/A  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* Rural part of UK. We have BSL against pitbulls and pitbull-mixes which is terribly unfair.  24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* Summers in the 70s and winters in the 40s. Rather a lot of rain!   \*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* Thanks in advance for all your insights. :)
