So I’m a 32 yr old white think I’m a straight but open minded male..so I was a late bloomer when it came to experiences anything sexual..if this story interests anyone or anybody have any questions I’ll give details and answer anything anyone wants...sorry first time posting on reddit and talking about this publicly forgive me...so I’ve always had anxiety or felt pressure when it came to sex with women...I’m sexually attracted and love being intimate with women, but have always felt pressure in feeling the need to please or perform well...also I’ve always felt weird in a sense of my idea fantasy woman to have sexy with is different than the woman I want to marry...so when I was in a drought I started dabbling with Craigslist and stumbled upon the M4m ads...now I love blowjobs but always felt women just did it to do it and if the woman was really pretty I felt awkward about looking at her sexually and naught and couldn’t picture her getting nasty with giving a good BJ I don’t know just seems like she was to pretty to be doing that...so I started to realize in the CL m4m when I got drunk and high and super horny that men would beg and love to give head and than you can leave right after...sorry to rant but I’m never this open and honest....when I would have a fling after I release id always want to leave right after but I’m a nice guy so would be upfront about it with women...it’s rare to find that but I didn’t want to be an asshole and make them feel used...with a woman I could see dating I wouldn’t get that but would feel more pressure to please those women...so with guys I dabbled in messaging and sometimes had them begging for my cock witch was a turn on and they say that’s all they want and nothing or hanging out after or anything...so one night I said fuck it in a drunk and high stage and got the best blowjob deepthroat edging and everything...since I knew I cum kinda fast I’d ask him to stop when I got close...I feel like a woman just wanted to get it over with...so the room was dark and I covered my eyes for the most part... he wanted to make it last and so did I so I didn’t drive all the way for 10 min or whatever...problem is I felt guilty after and tried to forget it...hated that feeling and when I’m sober I try to erase those memories but when I’m under the Influence especially white I love that feeling of being open and exploring that...when I’m sober I hate those feeling and I’m not attracted to or like anything about exploring with guys other than deepthroat blowjobs...but most people throw you in the gay category so I hate the guilt I feel and not being able to talk to judgemental friends and family about it...please some give me open minded advice or private message me...I’ve never admitted this and would love some feedback...sorry it’s so long and all over the place but figured I’d spill my gets being under the influence and willing to talk about it...love you reddit community please be kind I’m sensitive lol...
