I want to make a confession guys.. I am ashamed to be a muslim. The whole incident with the Tablighi Jamaat has brought tears to my eyes. I want to tell everyone that this is not what Islam teaches, Islam teaches you to obey the law of the land and put health of everyone else before yours. Haye, this preacher who has been spewing shit is the real shaitan, ya Allah (Bismillah Rahim) not for a moment did he even think about the news, neither did he for a moment stop and question his actions. When clearly in the Sahih Bukhari it has been written that where there is an endemic, don't enter the land and if you are in a land which has one don't run away from it. I am feeling so ashamed and sad that his stupid and incomprehensible actions will lead to the deaths of so many innocents. Allah (Bismillah Rahim) always said that if you have killed one person its as if you have killed all of humanity. This is not what Islam teaches us, it does not teach us to lie, to spread disease and to put our faith incorrugible and incorruptible before humanity. Alhamdullilah, I am able to reach out to all my brothers from this platform, I wish to tell all my friends and brothers - Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and all others that Islam doesn't teach this, we only wish to spread peace and I am really hurt and saddened by this Shaitan Maulana who has gone against the word of Allah (Bismillah Rahim), I have always understood that La Ilah Illallah Muhammad Ras Ulullah should be in ones heart, for me that means humanity, peace and a world free from strife and sadness. I am in tears right now and can't even imagine how many innocent people are going to die from this stupid act, I am sorry all my brothers for the grief and sadness a stupid act of this Maulana is going to cause. There is no apology that will fulfil the loss in your lives and this great country, I only wish and pray that Allah (Bismillah Rahim) shower his love and strength upon us all so that we may get through this.
