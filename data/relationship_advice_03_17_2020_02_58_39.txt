Hello, my bf of 5 years had sex with a prostitute and I can’t get over it. I am his first and only gf, he said that he is just curious and he wants to feel a different vagina to compare. When we plan a trip to Amsterdam last year, we had a big fight about that and I explained that how it hurts my feelings. Because I was doing Erasmus in another city and haven’t seen him for months at the time and I missed him so much but his plan was just to go redlight. I feel betrayed because he didn’t prefer to have sex with me and prefer to spend time with a prostitute. He said that I can wait for him outside and it’s not a big deal. After my big reaction, he said that he is sorry, apologized and I accepted. This year, he moved to Amsterdam and every night he started to spend hours walking on Redlight, then he opened the topic again and I said OK just because I want this stupid thing to happen and close it forever. I am happy that he is open and honest to me but I lost my self esteem and my trust to him. He says he asked me and I said OK but actually I wasn’t. It is also because he wanted to kiss the prostitute even I told him I am not ok with that and it didn’t correlate with his argument that it is just because of curiosity. Also he said that it was the same feeling sexually which make me feel that our 5 year relationship is not special at all since he compares a prostitute with me. We are not living together which makes things harder and I just feel so lost. I love him, he is the one for me and beside this one night our relationship is just perfect. However, even after 3 months it hurts and I couldn’t get over it. I started to check his location, emails etc., I want to rebuild trust in our relationship. I am open to any suggestions. How can I do that? Do you think that I will get better with time? I feel that it’s not fair but I also don’t know how to forgive the past.
