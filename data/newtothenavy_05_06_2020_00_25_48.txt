I had a question about this form. Have any of you been contacted by a private investigator or something regarding this form- or has this form come back to haunt any of you after you completed it? There are so many questions and different components of this form that you have to fill out, I'd be surprised if whoever is in charge of this form would go through every component of it for every person that completes it. Essentially the reason why I am asking this, is because while completing it I noticed there is a part asking where you have attended school. No problem, I don't mind sharing where I have went to college. HOWEVER, if someone were to look into this and contact the university there is a chance they would find out that I have been in trouble due to the fact I was formally punished for it and it was documented. I'm not saying I'm worried for them to find out I have been in trouble before, it's just what is was for which I am worried about. I have been filling out all other military documents including this one saying I have never tried drugs, not only because my piss is clean(and I've checked) but also because I don't partake in that anymore. I was never an addict, just a dumbass teen "experimenting". But if they ever were to contact this college and find out, things I said regarding drugs on this form and others wouldn't add up and I don't want to lose my opportunity to serve. It should also be noted I wasn't in trouble with police, I was just disciplined by the college. So I am turning to you guys to see if this is something I should worry about or not. I am sure I am not the only person trying to join the military with some skeletons in my closet. I am also sure I am not the only applicant who has experimented with drugs before, I unfortunately just got caught. I am sure every branch has to fill this out, and it doesn't seem likely that these people would fact check every single component of this document for every single person. Thanks in advance.
