I'm 16 and live in the Scottish borders and I'm looking for a pretty, cute, funny girl to have a relationship with, some things you should know about me before you approach me and we start talking are that I'm not wanting to have a relationship out of my country, I'm straight obviously, I'm a very right leaning conservative, so don't come at me saying that you were born a  boy but are now a girl or that you are a frying pan waiting for the right egg to be cracked on them or anything like that. Things I'm attracted to would be Red (ginger) or brown/brunette hair, curly or wavy hair- preferably long, green eyes, cute glasses (not a requirement), cute smile and a few more things that are a bit more explicit, oh and I'm a booty kinda guy. Things I'm looking for both physical and personality wise would be, slim to plum-ish figure, preferably on the slimmer side,  I'm 5"9 - 5"10, still got some growing to do, so someone within the 5"0 - 5"7 would be good. Personality wise, well similar interests would be amazing, so in terms of music I'm an old school Hip-Hop fan, I like some newer artists but no mumble rappers, I'm a metal head for life but no death, doom or black metal or anything like that, if you do listen to anything like that, just as long as you listen to other metal and keep the death and stuff to yourself, then we will be all good, I love beat boxing and even beatbox a little myself and I also listen to artists like Nightcore, S3RL and what not, so if any of those tick your boxes then great (preferably metal or rap) but its whatever, I game a lot, I'm on PS4 my tag is Basicx_GamezXd so if you wanna then add me I play MW as well so if you wanna hit up some cross-platform then lmk, I have a job as well but I'd have to tell you more about that in messages or whatever, my physicality emm.. isn't great ahaha, but I'm quite stocky and im losing the weight, I have brown hair, blue eyes, looking sexy AF lol, oh and I have dimples for any of you who think dimples are cute like me. But yeh that's ot for starters, if you are interested hmu in messages, at the core of it all I'm pretty lonely and scared for the future in terms of a relationship and I'm asking for someone who can help me and hold me because we all need a little lovin from time to time, but if you are interested then just lmk and we can get talking. :)
