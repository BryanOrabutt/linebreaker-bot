So I started dating my bf 7 months ish ago not really knowing what I was getting myself into. Heâ€™s infantry and is going into sniper section soon after he goes to ranger school and airborne school and sniper school. This past summer was great. We both fell in love really quick and were able to hang out a bunch for the most part and I thought man this is the one and so did he. Super happy and in love. Heâ€™s great. Then the past couple months have been testing us (or more so me). Heâ€™s basically had to work every single day for the past month+ and leaves for ranger school at the end of this next month. He has to be focusing every ounce of his energy on ranger school right now. I havenâ€™t been able to talk to him much at all cause heâ€™s been out training(at last min not knowing it until he goes and so he isnâ€™t able to tell me heâ€™s going). Donâ€™t hear from him for days out of no where. The other night when I was able to see him for a couple hours he told me he wasnâ€™t sure if this is healthy for me or if I could handle this. Heâ€™s seen my emotions hit pretty hard lately. Iâ€™m not used to this lifestyle but Iâ€™m really trying hard to be strong for him. And after a few days of not talking to him after that conversation Iâ€™m beginning to think he may be right....maybe this isnâ€™t for me. I really donâ€™t know if my heart can handle it. I donâ€™t know if I will be able to be happy with him being gone all the time and barely any contact. I begin to think what is the point? I CRAVE quality time and touch so much it hurts. I start to worry about having to go through this with kids. Heâ€™s not getting out anytime soon and Iâ€™m just starting to second guess if I can truly be happy in a military relationship. He is very busy with his goals right now that Iâ€™m not sure if he really even has time for me. I donâ€™t know what to do. I love him a lot. But Iâ€™m still so young (23) and I just donâ€™t know anymore. ðŸ’”
