I was on the phone the past two days with this dude explaining to me the program, how it works, you know basically giving me a rundown and it all sounded convincing, he said everything perfectly, basically everything I wanted to hear that I would be in a real recording studio getting hands on training, and I’m like okay, this all seems great, but the back of my mind I’m thinking this all sounds too good to be true, and the price for tuition is shiiiiii - over 12,000$. Me being a detective because I rather be safe than sorry, I start investigating on forums about this school, and the top result I get, well, THIS SCHOOL IS A SCAM! You know not the first thing you want to see when you have your hopes up because I really do want to learn music production, and if there’s a school that will teach me and give me all the resources and a mentor that will teach me and guide me, that’s awesome, but what most of these stories I hear from people who did this program, and at the price at 2,000$, they were basically working as janitors for these studio owners. I then start looking up these guys on social media, their portfolio, and I don’t even see one reference about this school, or the studio which is based where I’m at, nothing, and even if there at the local studio here, they don’t say shit about the program. I’m basically at the point where I’m like is this program legit? I mean come on no way it would cost over 12,000$ and just be a scam? But hey I know there’s some real scummy ass people on this planet, and I’m just straight up at the point where I need people’s personal experiences with the program, because what I’m looking at and everything I’ve literally just found, it seems like I just saved myself and my parents from the biggest money loss of our lives, 12,000 fooking dollars, I’m young, I’m 18, and I could be wrong about the program, but just take a minute and see where I’m coming from, you don’t prepare to pay that much money without thinking twice, and especially not to be a janitor. (aye no hate towards Janitors)
