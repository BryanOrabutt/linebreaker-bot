 Hi, thanks for reading. I am looking into inducing quickly but I need some advice on what to do. About 9 months ago I started taking fenugreek and dom together 3x a dat and I would produce a few clear drops when ever I would use my pump. I unfortunately stopped after about 2 weeks because of work. So a few months later I started again and added blessed thistle as well but the same thing happened (I stopped after 2 weeks.) So then about 3 weeks ago I watched a youtube video that said taking a birth control pill of both hormones and taking 2 dom pills 4x a day for 2 weeks would help induce so I decided to start that and I bought the birth control but this time I wasn't pumping or being stimulated like I should have. The birth control and dom only lasted a week together because the birth control made me very sick so I had to stop. So here I am and I have all this free time now with this virus to dedicate to trying to induce. I have a partner who introduced me to this lifestyle and I love it but I really want to induce quickly. For the past 4 days we started again and I am taking 1 dom pill , 1 blessed thistle pill and 2 fenugreek pills every 4 hours or so. I am also wanting to have suckle sessions every 3 hours but sometimes miss every session ( on average we get about 3 solid session in a day at about one hour a piece.) So what should I be doing now to try and induce this lacation as quickly as possible? My partner also just bought goats rue, lactation cookie ingredients, lactation tea, and fennel as well to add into the mix ( they will be arriving this weekend.) When I use my pump a few clear drops are produced and my breasts feel achey and sore now so I think it is working. What type of schedule should I be on? And how much dom and other herbal supplements should I be taking right now since it has been only 5 days? How often should we suckling and what can I do to speed up this process. I already have HH cups but I want them bigger and fast full of milk!
