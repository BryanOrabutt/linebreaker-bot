Me and this girl were talking for a few months and we got really close, like kissing and oral sex and all we had fun for a few weekends and then she asked me out... I said yes but after I said yes she didn't want anyone to know that we were dateing and when people asked what was happening between us she would say we are "just freinds" and that lowkey hurt me so I suggested that we become "unofficial" until she's ready to be open about the relationship but otherwise we carried on like usual... then one weekend she told me before hand that she wanted to have sex and take the next step and I was exited so we went to a club with a bunch of people one night on that weekend and we were sitting together she had one of her legs over mine and was pushing my hand closer to her groin on her inner thigh... and then one of the guys we came with took her to go say hello to her friend at the bar and then after a few minutes I saw them leave the club and go to the car we all came in... eventually my other friends told me to go look and then we went there and it didn't seem like they were doing anything so I left and said I told you so, but then i got asked to get the keys for the car from them so i went and as i went to open the door i saw them kissing in the back seat and I left instantly. Then I went back to the bar and told my friends at this point i didn't know how to feel... then the guy who was in the cars best freind came up to me and said that they both want to see me separately... so I spoke to the guy first and he was saying how sorry he was and that it "just happend" and then I went to her and she was in tears..(he was sober and she was kinda drunk) and she was saying how she fucked up so badly and then when we were alone she told me that she really loved me and that she had no feeling for him and that it ment nothing and now I dont know what to do.
