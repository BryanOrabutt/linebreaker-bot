So I had this "friend" we talked only in class in middle school barely had her only like 2 or 3 classes we talked alot during them because class is boring going to say her name so I don't have to say her or stuff it's Joey bot saying last name for obvious reasons but let's continue so we talked but after that  semester I didn't have her anymore for the rest of the second semester it was the first semester I had classes with her just to be clear, i didn't even see her at all the second semester well 8th grade comes around and my depression has worsened by then to the point I completely forget some things because I could careless to remember or put a effort to remember I was just a dipshit depressed and tired guy with many more difficulties than that obviously but I'm going of subject so I had this other friend of mine who I guess was friends with her but she came up to me pushing her forward saying " hey Alex remember Joey?" And Joey just smiling almost like she was lost at words or blushing I don't know I wasn't reading her well and I wasn't trying but it was weird I didn't remember her because dipshit here could care less to remember but I just said no and she looked sad and my friend just said sorry and I walked off, well highschool year junior yay celebration close to leaving hell well I had a class with her she remembered my name it took me whole lot of time to remember hers we didn't talk until we got a seating chart where she sat in front of me well even then we didn't talk but I this time my suspicious were up why well I have a girlfriend who and before we sat next to each other (Joey) me and my girlfriend would sit in the cafeteria doing couple stuff (watching anime) but I would notice because I would always look around because I have ADHD and very curious what people would be doing but I notice her just stare at us days past by as us doing this and when we hug and do silly things together I can notice in the corner of my eye her rolling her eyes staring I don't understand so back to her sitting in front I decided to draw because bored but I get a sneaking suspicion she's watching me I don't say anything nor do I look up to see because she'll just turn away so all I do is write negative shit on my art like "fuck I can't draw" " I suck" the normal stuff well she just goes your art isn't bad I'm confuzled she was watching and reading the stuff I was writing well we talk and stuff this goes on for like a week or two or three before another seating chart change were talking and she has mentioned her coffee which she says is delicious and stuff well out of the random she says hey want to taste some after we were talking and she took a break to sip her cup and I can visibly see theirs no cup or anything were she can offer me in so we're the hell am I supposed to drink from if not the hole the cup has well I decline because tea for life and hot chocolate but yeah also my girlfriend had a class with her she said her and Joey's friends were in a group together and they got into the subject of guys they liked (mean type) Joey describes her ideal man as Mexican tall not far I mean like not skinny but not far so the middle black hair dark brown eyes...I'm all of this but hey she can be talking about someone else right...right? I have another girl I want to discuss about me and my friends had a whole thing with her (not like into but like shit happened) we called it the Code F because for fun but I don't know if I should post it it's quite long let me know if you people are interested in me explaining it and asking a few questions for you guys?
