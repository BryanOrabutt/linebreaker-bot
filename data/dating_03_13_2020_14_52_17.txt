I have been seeing a guy from three months and I started to have feelings for him after this realization I got scared and was encouraged by my friends to shoot my shot and tell him how I feel. The thing is 90% of what we do is physical and his intentions at the start were "just to get to know me" so I had my doubts he felt the same way. I went to hang out with him a couple days ago and we talked and talked then I asked if his intentions had changed and he said he didn't think so. He asked me if mine changed and I said yes but I didn't want it to be weird between us. Well things got physical again that evening and things happened and I ended up need to take plan b and we decided to take a break from physical activity together but I realized that's 90% of what we do so I'd essentially not see him for a while so I decided to just be blunt and tell him exactly what was on my mind instead of backing down. I told him I probably shouldn't of slept with him that night because I had feelings for him and he said he wasn't sure what to say but I assured him he didn't have to say anything I then told him that I probably shouldn't see him for a long time which then he said he understood and immediately went to the restroom for a second?? Maybe I upset him I don't know because he didn't actually use the restroom he just turned the sink on for like 30 seconds and then came back out. Weird. Anyways when. He got back I decided that he may be uncomfortable and I should go so. I told him I was gonna go and I left and he said "see ya" in this nervous voice and watched me leave his driveway through his window. I'm not used to telling people how I really feel so this was a tough tough thing for me to do but should I have handled this differently what do I make of it? Is three months long enough to know if you want any type of relationship with someone or should I have been more patient? I don't know what to think. Thanks in advance.
