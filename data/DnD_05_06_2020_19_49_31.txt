so ive been playing dnd online exclusively over discord and then all this corona shit came on so even more people are doing it, so its cool. So im in 3 campaigns and 1 of them is pretty nice i like the dm hes cool. The other 2 my irl buddy is dm'ing so thats cool but i have a few problems with campaign. And i dont want to complain about everything but when its dnd and the sessions last 3-7 hours if i dont enjoy the session thats a huge ammount of time in a day to not be enjoying it. One of the things is that every npc is a huge dick, the one shopkeeper i gave him a platinum and i was gonna ask for the change which was like 8 gold but he gave me my drink and i first asked what the drink was and jokingly out of character the other player said "no get your change your money" and then the DM said nope he already took it, which im not that mad at but then i brought out my weapon and started threatening him cause i was a little salty and he just said he doesnt care and i was trying to get a intimidation roll and at that point i wanted to burn the place down so i started to make a scene and start hitting the desk with my warhammer and the DM was just saying that it does absolutely nothing and i get that if he doesnt want me to do something dumb and make a scene but then the fuck shouldn't of took my money. And then real quick after we try to grab our horse from a stable and we have a 20 minute arguing spree about them not giving us a ticket and we kept saying they didnt give us one and the dm said theres a few people at the counters and our warlock went up trying to intimidate the guy and then the dm said well the about 36 people behind the counters step up with weapons and then we had a short argument about the wording on a "few" so whatever and we got the horse and left.And sorry if this is long i just wanted to vent cause i haven't been enjoying these sessions. And then in the same campaign we were in a bar and long story short our body got pushed in a pit and was forced to fight in a ring (it was great) but one of the bartenders stepped up on the table and was the announcer and the DM was saying that its hard to hear anything cause of how loud the screaming was so i being a little mischievous dwarf i said that i rolled like 100 ball bearings or something at his feet and the dm said to roll a sleight of hand check I ROLLED A 18 AND HE SAID THAT HE INSTANTLY NOTICED i really dont know how with the super loud screaming and him with a microphone announcing this fight, i call bullshit that this guys passive perception was 18, and its not like these little things ruin my whole night but almost all the time i try to do something clever or something like no matter the situation or roll it almost never works out. And one last experience is with another campaign that im almost certainly dropping out of we were arrested for punching kids and we all escaped in handcuffs and ran into the woodline and i remember getting to the treeline i then ran then dashed another 30 feet and then used misty step so im like 120-150 feet away but todays session the DM saying i wasnt at the treeline yet at all and theres people in the party ahead of me and all the guards caught up to me and a bunch of other bullshit. I think i need a break from dnd cause i am getting in a bad mindset sometimes but if im gonna being dedicating a average of like 6 hours every week like i need to be enjoying it im playing dnd for personal enjoyment, and im not super self centered but my enjoyment is pretty high priority.
