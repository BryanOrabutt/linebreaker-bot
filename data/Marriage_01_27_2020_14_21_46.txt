So back in October I was out hunting one night and my wife went out with some friends. I was to pick them up at 2am from the bar, well by the time I got my dog and made it to the bar I ended up getting there early at about 130am. I walked inside to find her and just hangout but I didn’t see her. I walked up to one of her friends and asked if she had seen my wife. But all she said was don’t be mad like 3 times. Finally I just said take me to her and she led me to the bathroom door. I could hear my wife inside but I was thinking maybe she was sick and embarrassed so I gave her a few min. I knock on the door again and stand there like an idiot for about 10 min. And this bathroom is only like a 8ft by 4ft room toilet in back left and sink to the back right. But the door comes open and this guy walks out fixing his pants and I see my wife walking to the sink not from the toilet. I have never felt this betrayed in my life. I yell at the guy and said that’s my f-ing wife, but I was just like fuck it and walked out and went to my truck. I regret that mostly, like I should have did something but we have 2 kids at home 6yo boy and a 3 yo girl that I love more than my life. Anyway I still waited on them and took them home, told her I was done and left the state for a couple days before I couldn’t take being away from my kids any longer and came back. And every time I feel like it I can just live with it and get on with our lives, I find out more like she wasn’t paying any of my bills for months. Or she tried it with some other guy but he walked away when he saw her ring. I told her I could live with it but I really can’t get it out of my head and she won’t talk about it. I don’t think I can just get over it but I gotta be with my kids. I think I just need so advise or anything, just something.
