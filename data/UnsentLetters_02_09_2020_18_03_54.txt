You know, I knew something wasn’t right when I said I was ready for the next step. I wanted more and you said you did too, but there was something not quite right and I couldn’t put my finger on it. I should have listened to my gut. One of my friends warned me about listening to myself but I didn’t want to see anything but the perfect person I thought you were. You made me the happiest person on the planet. You weren’t my first, but we had so many firsts together, and I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. Within months I was head over heels and you let me put fucking everything into us, knowing you wouldn’t ever give back. When you broke up with me I was heart broken. I was so in awe of you for putting your Mum first and helping her through the worst time of her life when she had been diagnosed with cancer. But it wasn’t true was it? Why didn’t you tell me you were married? How am I supposed to forgive myself for being the intruder in an already functioning relationship? I never would have responded to your approaches if I’d have known. Imagine my absolute heartbreak to find out that not only were you married, you were seeing yet another poor unsuspecting idiot too. Three people who deserve so much fucking better. I just thought you were decent and happy for me to be seeing friends and family, but you were just fitting us all in. You didn’t even have the courage to tell me about any of it. I had to find out from one of your friends and you put them in the shittiest situation and they had to do your dirty work for you. Years on I’m still hurting. I sometimes wish you’d have picked me. I still hurt. But then I remind myself I love someone who doesn’t exist. I never knew the real you, and in reality I know I had a lucky escape. I couldn’t trust you. I would drive myself crazy wondering where you were and what you were doing and I deserve better. Thank you for teaching me not to wear my heart on my sleeve.
