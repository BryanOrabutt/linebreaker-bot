Hi, I have had the battle with depression for 10 years off and on. Every time I feel like "disappearing" I look at the ripple effect. Who would it effect if I died. My family, some friends, my pets, maybe my boyfriend and his family? It all just seems like garbage. I'm hardly liked by anyone it seems. I fuck up a lot I guess. But every human does. Some days I want to be around. To be social. To leave the room I own with my boyfriend in his parents house. It seems like every time I leave this room I get somehow into trouble by what I said or what I say that others have said. New plan is to stay to the room unless I have to use the restroom or shower. I have some snacks in our room plus I dont eat as much anymore maybe a meal if that a day. The more I'm quiet though I get in trouble because they want to know what I'm thinking. Like do you really care? Do you care that my mom is battling cancer but was never in my life or that my father is dying basically but he didnt come into my life until like 6 years ago but hardly there. My family that I had doesnt care about me. I have no friends anymore because I had to lose contact with them due to my boyfriend didnt like them. My pets...I love them to death and they all know it I hope. This stupid virus is a huge issue. Does it matter how many times I've been hurt, molested, or raped? No. No matter what happens to me I always come out more damaged but i put on an act, a face, that I'm stronger when it weighs down on me. I dont matter cause if I did my family would care about me. My mom would text or call. My father would want to hear from me. I'd have friends to share stories and laugh with. My boyfriend would love me and want to be more about me instead of his family and video games for 80% of the day. Like who values games more than their significant other? Whatever it doesnt matter...
