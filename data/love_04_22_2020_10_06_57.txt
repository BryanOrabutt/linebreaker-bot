What is "love"? this has bothered me for a while,  i realise i do not understand what is the concept of "love". I never really felt it in my life, not from my parents nor from anyone, i say i love thing but i simply just like them cuz they provide some sort of gratification in return, such as love a book or a video game, i also know and understand the concept of friendship and i have made quite many friends,  i know the limitations of friendship, however i never understand what it means to "love". I have read into the subject and it seems that love is just "they want to be with another person". For me every relationship i have with everyone is always, a deal, a trade, an exchange, a unwritten contract, a transaction of me getting something in return from another, my parents "love" me cuz i make money for them or i need to give them something in return  or else i am meanless to them as my mother have told me my whole life, she doesn't love me because i exit but she expects the value i provide, she doesn't love "me" she only love the stuffs that i can do for her,  so what is really "love"? While i really appreciate all my friends but i don't feel that i "love" them i simply understand that they are nice people and i don't want to hurt them and i also understand that if i cannot provide any meaningful value to them then i am worthless, i feel that i owe them, its a debt i must repay to their kindness, and i also know that they will ultimately choose their families and themselves over me and that is understandable. I felt infatuated towards someone but i know its temporary and not something i feel long lasting, So what is really love? Is it just good friend with sexual benefits? I would like to imagine that there must be more to it? I never had a girl friend and as i grew older i realized that what i want is just sex and not "love". So do love really exist? Or we just confusing infatuation or good friends with sex benefits to be love?
