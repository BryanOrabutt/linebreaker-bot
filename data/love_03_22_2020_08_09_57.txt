So I’ve know this girl for like 3 years now, since I first saw her I thought she was gorgeous, but one of my good friends liked her, because I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship I never said anything because of this me, my friends and her became really good friends and talked all the time, about 2 years after my friend starts disliking her and doesn’t talk to her for a while , a year after he gets a girlfriend and because of this, I develop feelings for the the girl. In about august of last year I kinda starting talking to her more than I used to (side note: I rarely talk to her through text or phone, but we talked a lot in person alone).this goes on until November, where I befriend a group of girls from the grade above me and where willing to give me advice and tips to get with her, me and the girl keep talking and we kinda look at each other from time to time.We leave for Christmas break, when we come back in January the first week, the girls  from the grade above me are pushing me to make a move( side note: I am super shy) and I keep procrastinating, in Thursday of that week, my final class is a class is a sort of study hall and me, a friend of mine, and one of the girls from the grade above me are talking and they help me set a plan for a date,it’s pretty stupid by at the end it worked, At the end of school, I was going to pretend like I have to tell her something but then delay it for tomorrow and the next day when she asks me what I was going to tell her I ask her out, I procrastinate I couple more, but finally agreed I do it. School ends and me and my friend are standing there, I see her but don’t say anything, at this point I’m pussying out but in my mind I’m telling my self I have to do it so I stand there and my ride is not here yet neither is her ride, so we stand there until everybody leaves and we start talking a little, suddenly my ride and her ride come basically together so we start walking in the direction, she starts walking in front of me and I say it’s now or never and tell her to wait up and tell her than I have to tell you something, but I has to be tomorrow, she is kinda weirded out and tells me okay, we both say good bye and we both leave. Friday comes and she never mentions that I was going to tell her something that day ( she typically asks me during earlier periods what I was going to tell her but no this time) and I’m in my study hall talking to the girl from the upper class, she is telling me to do it and I ,like always , procrastinate, she tells me that it will work. I say fuck it and filled with courage I run to they exit looking for her, the exit is filling up with people and I don’t see her, I go to the very exit and stand there wait if I see her, she goes to her locker and I start pussying out, as I’m telling my self to do it I see 2 of the 3 girls from the upper class telling me to do it from a distance, as I look I see the girl pass by and leaves to her car. I stared at her as she was leaving without doing anything, the 2 girls look at me in disappointment and angry, I start thinking that I lost my chance and It was all lost. Another one of my friends comes up to me and starts talking to me, I don’t even pay attention and was just thinking about how I fucked up as I turn I see the girl walking back towards me, I couldn’t have sworn I was dreaming or something because shit like that doesn’t happen, luck was on my side, she comes to me and my friends and says if we have turned in our journal( our history teacher makes us write stories in our journal about how we would have lived in the time periods we talk about in class) and we both tell her we haven’t( thank god) and we start walking towards the school office( he tells us to drop it there and he’ll pick it up later) we start  walking and she stops me and tells me that she hasn’t forgotten that I have to tell her something (what I did yesterday) we start walking and we get to the office, and we are waiting there and she notices that I had my braces removed, she comments on how I look much better and we both smile at each other, we turn in our journal and we start walking towards the exit, as we are walking, she asks me what I was going to tell her, I stop her and at this point it’s just me and her alone, I tell her”do you really want to know?” And she says “yes” and I’m kinda silent and I’m pussying out, but I tell her “I want to invite you” and she smiles and says “where?” And I say “to the movies”, she says “you know my mom wouldn’t let us” (side note: her mom is super strict and doesn’t let her go out with guys), I tell her “you can just tell her you are going out with your friend and I’ll meet you there”, she says “yes, but not this weekend because I’m grounded” I tell her “we’ll figure out a date but agreed, we both stand there and she says they are waiting for her and has to go, we both say goodbye and she leaves, I start freaking out mentally and I leave also, I am super happy that whole weekend, Monday goes by and we talk a little and she makes references to going to the movies with me to her friend, but after that they we just stop talking (this always happens to me because I’m supper shy and after I make a move or do nothing I stop talking to them in fear of say something stupid and making them lose interest) we don’t talk til day, but we still look at each other, she looks at me and when I turn to her she looks alway, around February it came out that she and a guy from a grade above me are talking a lot and have feeling for each other this breaks my heart but I roll with it they day before Valentine’s Day I buy her a rose for delivery ( every Valentine’s Day my school sells things to give to other people through a delivery system), Valentine’s Day comes around and out teacher is saying what each of us got and from whom we got it, I have to sit there looking at how many things she got from the guy in the upper grade and I only gave her a rose, she didn’t come up to me to say thank you, after school she sends me a text and thanks me for the rose, I tell her that you are welcome, since then I haven’t talked to her and she hasn’t talked to me, what should I do, I’ve been wanting to send her a text but have 0 clue of what to tell her, and with the quarantine, I don’t see her and I miss her, what should I do?
