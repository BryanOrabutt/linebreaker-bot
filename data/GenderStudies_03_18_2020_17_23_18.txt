Ok so I’m 19 and I took psych and sociology in HS. There’s always so much debate around genders and stuff. It’s hard to find research about it I think cuz it’s still mostly a new concept. But here’s what I believe...              there is a difference between someone’s sex, gender, and sexual preferences. Some over lap and that’s why it causes so much uproar. A persons biological sex is either male or female (or the mixes of the two, which come as anomalies I would say) this biological difference if from a persons chromosomes, making them male or female, and appearing such, and mostly defines their sexual preferences (who their attracted to). Now gender isn’t a physical trait someone has, and is different than their biological sex. This is what people get confused and think that sex is the same as gender. But gender is of the mind and can differ. Now idk about 76 or infinite genders. But there’s definitely more than 2. And these are how to person feels about themself, but is still different than preferences and sex. That’s why a person can be biologically female (body and look of a female), have a male gender (the male trapped in a female body) and still be gay attracted to men). It’s all super confusing because it overlaps so much. And I know there has been proof that the male and female brains are different, and that a male could have a female brain. And vise versa. There was a case where two biological males (I think) were born, but one had his penis removed (i don’t remember why) so they raised him as a female. And “she” always felt wrong is a way, and eventually found out why and changed back into a male. This shows that we do have a set way we are. Now this is mainly about transgender people and things but it’s helps the case of genders I feel. Back to before, being gay,straight, bi, and others  I would say are your sexual preferences. Attractions. Okay I’m running out of things to talk about, I thankyou if you’ve read this far. I’m no expert. And please if you have and comments about what I think about all this is please ask.
