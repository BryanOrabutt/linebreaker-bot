The first one, two friends (male and female, engaged) of mine were awake (little backstory, I live with them and my mom and sleep in their room with them) were awake. They woke me up to do some adult things, and we did but I had grit my teeth the whole time to keep quiet and had loosened my two teeth, one on the top and one below it, and I played with them, getting them to fall out. I showed them, but one turned out huge and fake looking. It was weird as hell. In another one, same thing, except I woke up alone and checked those two teeth, and they were still loose but I ignored it. The two friends were outside with another boy, I don't know who he was. The teeth fell out again but this time, a lot of blood. Dylan sat beside me and rubbed my back because I was panicking and spit some of the blood out, before leaning over the edge of the porch and spitting out even more. That's all I remember before jumping into the last one.  Friend one, wife, had come home early and woke up friend 2, husband, to go to work. So D gets up and A stays in bed, looking through a box for something. I go out, ready to smoke, D is sitting on the couch, with my brother laying with him on the couch. Or maybe it was that other boy. I don't know. But I went to open the door and it was still dark out. The porch had half walls instead of banisters around it except for in front of the stairs and there was this huge wagon that was moving back and forth, slowly. It was weird but I tried opening the door more but something was stopping it, so I pushed harder and was about to look around when fingers wrapped around to the other side showing someone else was out there with me. I screamed for Dylan and then woke up.... Weird dream level 1000. Sure beats all the other weird dreams I've had so far. It left me with an uneasy feeling and i woke up, actually woke up this time, crying.
