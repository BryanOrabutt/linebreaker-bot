I was driving through a neighborhood with some friends in my big Jeep. It was in the middle of winter, so it was super snowy out and thick ice on the road. Well, as I was coming around this corner, I started sliding sideways down this road and it was a steep hill, so I gained some serious speed. All I can remember think is "F***!" And all my friends were yelling, because they knew it was out of my hands at this point as we just waited for my car to stop wherever it decided to stop. Ended up sliding into a brand new car with the dealership tags still on it that was parked on the street. My driver side door connected with his back bumper so hard, it bounced us into his yard. I step out to look at the damage and saw I barely had a ding in my door. But I ripped his back bumper off, the trunk had popped open, and one of his tires was popped with the rim bent from smashing it into the curb. His neighbor was in the driveway across the street and saw the whole thing go down oh, so I walked up to the front door still parked on their lawn and rang the doorbell. No one answers. knock on the door and ring the doorbell again. Still no one. I walked back to my car and pull out and notebook in my backpack and a pen. I started writing on this piece of paper and went back to the back of my car to write down my license plate number. The neighbor was still shoveling his driveway when I went to put the note up on their door. I got in my car to drive away and the neighbor thanked me for leaving my information. The note actually read "sorry I f***** your s*** up." I had faked writing my license plate to make it look legit to the neighbor. Even my friends in the car didn't know that I did that. I waited the next few days, weeks, months, and nothing. I was a walking anxiety attack for a long time after that. I just figured I was going to get caught. This was about 10 years ago, and I still feel so thought about this whole situation.
