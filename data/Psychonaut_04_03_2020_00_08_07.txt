im 15 years old and ever since I took a tab and a half of acid on 2020 new years ive been experimenting with psychedelics. but one night me and a couple friends wanted to trip tf out so we all took 3 220ug tabs and one of my friends started to have a really fucked up trip, was seeing death demons and shit but didn't tell us and just let it sit in his mind until he got really freaked out and scared. then he called his fucking mom and said "momma" in the most shaky frightened voice ive ever heard him talk in so I grabbed the phone and said "he's at my house and hes safe" but obviously she was worried asf so at 1 AM she came to my house and at this point my friend who called his mom was really freaking out but not saying a word, just eyes open wide and blank. so the other 2 friends and me were also freaking out because of how fucked up we were and he ended up stripping down in front of us so we threw a blanket on him and ran upstairs and I went to my moms room and told her everything. so when his mom came he was still naked standing and spinning in circles in my room and his mom and my mom tried to get him into the car but he ended up struggling a lot because apparently he was fighting demons in hell, so he ends up hitting the glass of water out of my moms hand smashing it on the drive way, falling over cutting himself and him mom so now there's blood everywhere. and meanwhile I'm fucking freaking tf out because my  friends are saying go help him and so is my mom and i was just caught in a loop of running through the house so fucking terrified and when i went outside i halucinated that his head was  exploded on the ground and i had to pick him up and put him in the car but i couldn't fucking do that since i was on 660ug so i kinda just looked at him and ran inside and sat in the guest bedroom for the next 6 hours thinking omg i just killed him, hes dead its all my fault. and then it all went to a spiral of past trauma being brought up in my head but in the morning we were all fine and  i thought nothing of it, it was just a shitty trip. but now a month or so later i feel like I'm going insane for absolutely no reason i hear shit and am really anxious when i talk to anyone and ive developed a stutter.
