Just rescued a 12 week old Aussie mix a little over a week ago. Everything was off to a great start, she didn't have an accident in the house for the first 5 days and I thought I hit the jackpot. I took her out about every 2 hours or when she seemed like she was ready and she'd pee everytime. When she went I would reward her with a treat that she only gets when she potties outside (cooked chicken) and stay outside longer. Then on the 6th day she had her first accident. I didn't think much of it as I was expecting this when getting a puppy, but it has gotten much worse. Now she almost refuses to pee when we are outside. I take her out multiple times within an hour to the same area where she is supposed to go and she won't go, then we get inside and within a few minutes she'll pee. I started crate training her the first night she was here so she doesn't cry much in the crate but she recently started peeing in the crate as well. I take her on walks/runs/outdoor playtime for over an hour each day after work. I'm trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. I've read through a ton of the posts here over the past few days and I've been trying some of the strategies. I take her to the same spot, I've been using a command when she's about to go, giving her a treat and extending the walk after. The issue is that I can't constantly have her on my lap and it feels like as soon as I put her down she pees, even if we go outside first. Sometimes it feels like she holds it until she has the opportunity to go in the house. I don't understand why this is happening after she was doing so well the first few days. When she does go inside I don't punish her, I try to clap or say her name to scare her out of it but she doesn't stop. We live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building so there is really no good way to rush her outside either. Just looking to see where I am going wrong. I feel like I'm failing as her mom.
