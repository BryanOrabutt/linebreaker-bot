A little background - my father and I have had a rather Rocky relationship for pretty much as long as I can remember. He's a narcissist, controlling and has been emotionally and mentally abusive for my entire life. My parents divorced when I was about 6, and my dad fought dirty for residential custody and won. So, he's always been there - always had power over me, in just about every way possible. My mom and I are best friends, no issues there, and my dad asks me sometimes why he and I don't have the same relationship. He's someone who likes to stir the pot, and then lay low and hope that I forget what happened after a shallow apology and quick sweep under the rug. He tends nowadays to be a hypocrite as well, giving advice and his opinion/two cents when it's not asked for; saying that he isn't telling me what to do, but rather is telling me what a 'good' or 'smart' decision would be. He talks a lot of smack, especially about my significant other.. and likes to put me down around him. For example, tonight on the phone with him he asks if I am going back to college. (taking a break due to mental health, have been off for 1 yr, and my SO has been off for 1yr & 1/2.) I answered truthfully, that I had been thinking about it but hadn't decided on a school yet. And his response was 'if you don't do back, you never will. Just look at your SO'. And by the end of the call, he's asking me to find a day that I'm off work so he can come see my SO and I..... About 90% of the time I ignore his calls and texts because I simply don't want to deal with this type of interaction, because it happens every time. Anyone have any suggestions on how I can set boundaries? I'm not afraid of him anymore but he's one who will blame anyone and everyone else in my life if what I say or do isn't exactly what he wants/expects to hear and see from me. Just struggling to come up with a solid plan on my own. And insight is greatly appreciated.
