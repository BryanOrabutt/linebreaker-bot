Hello I’m 24 (F) I’m feeling really low as I write this everything is feeling out of control I’m pursing a degree in the medical field and am In a highly competitive program I also have a ptsd from a rape, a learning disability and a autoimmune disorder despite this I’ve worked my ass off and have a 4.0 and am highly involved in my department and volunteer on my free time. Lately my home life has not allowed me to focus I feel like I have to fight for study time or rest and am treated poorly my family accuses me of being on drugs even with my busy schedule I came home from school and they accuse me of taking all the spoons from the house to do drugs with them they accuse me of stealing Alchol the house hold wine opener etc I got deathly ill and had to be admitted to the hospital and they treated me horribly thinking I was coming off of drugs and That’s why I was so sick even though I passed the drug test they gave me they said I only passed because they would be out of my system by then I don’t even drink and now I’m paranoid to even talk to anyone because I’ll be accused and idk why they said it’s because I come home from school with too much energy and am too excited and now my bf is starting to be abusive to me he fights at me cusses at me for nothing even when it’s something he’s done I’m gone 7 am -8 pm and still have to study when I get home I feel like it’s useless to try anymore and the more I defend myself the worse I get treated no one will let me focus on school and realize I’m happy and excited what can I do I feel Like I wish I was dead because of all the pressure from school and the abuse at home I feel like I can’t go on my autoimmune disorder makes me sick and everyone’s so mean to me about it or they’re like what now Im seriously starting to hate myself I only feel good at school because i can do well there and no one hurts me....
