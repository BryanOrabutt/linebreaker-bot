One night in the late 80’s my father was waking back from a hunting trip to his parents house (its about a 15 minute walk) it was a cold,crisp night, and he was walking his normal trail through the woods back to his parents house. He knew it like the back of his hand but it felt, sinister. While he was walking he had seen a crow fly, it could’ve been him or something else, he passed it off as I would.  Before I tell you the rest I will tell you the legend of the skinwalker (we know it’s probably it’s not real but we believe it because of the fun of it) it’s an old Navajo legend that is of an old dangerous medicine man or witch that has gained the evil power of shape shifting. There’s more to the story but I will continue. While he was walking he was thinking of the legend but he heard an owl hoot. And that didn’t alert him until he thought of the legend, a skinwalker will take the shape of an owl to get closer to you without alerting you. The owl quickly flew off without him really watching it, he walked on. He was a realistic man, still is, he believes what he knows is the truth. He heard commotion coming from the side of the trail, the trail was a well used deer trail to the lake that was nearby, and then a group of deer ran across the trail in front of my dad. He suspected that it was a coyote since coyotes frequented that trail to hunt. But the commotion didn’t stop after the deer were long gone. Me and my dad have been in hunting trips where we walked back to the truck being trailed by a pack of coyotes. He said that it sounded more bear sized than anything, he said he saw a man like thing wearing some hide of an animal run across the trail in front of him. He knew it wasn’t an Animal he wanted to mess with so he fired his revolver twice in the direction of the thing and it ran past and knocked him down in the process. He walked home admiring the experience but being weary all the same. He went home and hunted on the same trail for many years ahead.
