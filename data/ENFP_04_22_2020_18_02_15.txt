Ive noticed i have ENFP's Extraverted intuition and Introverted feeling, i basically always get a feeling from certain environments and tend to be really emotional and another thing i have is the excitement that comes to me when i hear about possibilities and im presented with the future things that could happen but the thing is that i cant make those, after reading some studies ive noticed the reason why as a kid is used to be rlly creative most of the time, but when i got into a strict school in my hometown i slowly started losing it, my own way of studying and doing things was trampled by the school they spammed textbooks and i was raised always having to study a certain way or do things a certain way i remember every kid used to be able to do all of the homework but i would only be able to only do 1 as i had already forgotten the other 5 lol. But what im trying to say is that society gets rid of your creativity it makes you think in a linear way so that you can fit into society(someone who doesnt think in a linear way would see beyond the world in front of them therefore not meeting societal standards)ive read some studies and it mentions that multitasking improves creativity the thing that all perceiver types do, we lose motivation and move on to the next fun thing but you see i was always this way even now but i was never able to finish anything i started so i started beating myself up and decided to just do one thing at a time forcing myself to be the person i wasnt i even developed a routine that was always the same, my way of thinking was so linear but then when we all went into quarantine i started feeling more free i had less responsibilities, free time and no school system to keep confined thats why now i feel as though my creativity has been the best its ever been and ive found hobbies that i never thought i would like. If you dont believe this study i can give you a comparison, Ne dominants are said to have millions of hobbies and thats a lot of multitasking which makes you creative due to how your allowing yourself to be open to many different possibilities instead of being stuck in the box this also helps with thinking outside of the box, you cant escape the box if the only place you feel comfort in is the box but thats when you become creative, you become creative when you decide that there is something outside of the box you could even present the box as the modern world it wants us to work in offices and develops a school system that makes us linear thinkers so that in the future as we grow we are not able to look outside of this modern world to other possibilities, as i was growing up this confinement made me develop OCD and even depression so whenever i get put in a place where i dont have many options or i have only one thing to do my mind starts creating OCD compulsions for me to do and repeatedly asking myself the purpose of my life as i felt i had no value at a point but now i would even consider homeschooling but if school comes back ill just do after school stuff to keep me creative i guess
