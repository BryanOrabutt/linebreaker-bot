Hello guys and girls of reddit, I honestly just feel so frustrated with life. I hate being stuck in my house ALL the time with this corona bullshit. I feel so depressed and my grades in uni are really taking a dive. I could blame it on the online system that they have going but deep down I know it's just me being a bad student. I have D and F in all of my major classes (computer science) and a B in a bio class that is meant to be easy as an upper division GE for non bio majors. I have no income as I am not working right now due to corona so I have to limit my spending. Been smoking an insane amount of weed just because I cant deal with being sober for some reason. I also have this girl that I've been working on getting to trust me for months. She finally opened up to me and we started playing online games. She plays call of duty, never really played shooters but I'm trying to learn so I can bond with her through the game but I suck... so much. It's even worse when she wanted to play Apex Legends. She is very good at these games and cares a lot about winning but I feel like I slow her gameplay a lot when I'm just complete trash and on her team. I also help her with her homework as she is a year under me in uni and is in the same major but sometimes I feel so inadequate. Sometimes I am able to answer her questions and it feels good when she gets happy that she finished an assignment but other times I dont know the answer to why her program is running into issues and I feel like I'm failing her and she wont want me. I hate the I feel this way as anytime I queue up with her in games I feel this massive amount of stress to not die every second and maybe make an impressive play to impress her and show that I'm getting better but it rarely happens. I know the key is to be confident and believe in yourself but I dont know how to convince myself that that's true when everytime I try to do something I'm either mediocre or just outright trash.
