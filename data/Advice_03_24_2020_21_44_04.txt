I'm struggling to cope with looking after my dad during this pandemic. My dad aged 63, suffered from Hepatitis C, medication didn't work so he had to have a liver transplant. All this was successful but not without complications. He suffers from neuropathy in his feet, this is constant pins/needles or his feet feeling like blocks of ice. Headaches, pain on his scar and other problems. All this has made him miserable for over 5 years. Couple years ago it all got too much for him and he was admitted into a psych ward for suicide watch. Things got a bit better after that and he was ok for a while, but obviously there were bad days and good days. He got banned from his general practice for shouting at the manager for how terrible the service was. Now he refuses to get a new doctor. Fast forward to 2020, he has a swollen left leg, I made him call his liver specialist nurse to see if she could help, she was worried it could be DVT(deep vein thrombosis) so she made him an appointment at the hospital to  check it, it came back false. The letter he received told him to see his GP but he refuses to go back to his old practice or find a new one. He keeps telling me how he wants to just die and how life is just miserable and a waste of time. I feel like his dog is the only thing keeping him from doing anything stupid again. I'm doing my best to help him, I didn't let him walk the dog today because he needs to rest his leg, he can't even stand up properly. He obviously didn't like that I stopped him and he called me rotten and a horrible son. Walking the dog is probably the only thing he enjoys in life right now. I love my dad, he's my best friend but it's getting too much for me, it's stressing me out seeing him suffer the way he is and I just wish I could help him. Covid-19 makes things worse, he has a low immune system so I can't exactly take him to the hospital as he is high risk. I just don't know what to do or how to handle the situation anymore.
