If my parents hadn’t confirmed that I was gone for a few hours, I would’ve thought it was a memory. When I was a child (3-4) I went to this very popular cultural festival in my birth country that happened in the mountains. Basically it’s a week long celebration and there’s a massive parade. My family went to this temple that was high up and was only accessible by walking a ton of stairs. Anyways, when we get up there, there are tourists taking pictures of the statues and the view. I remember wandering off and I get to this part in the temple where the grass was really high and I begin walking to this gazebo structure that overlooks the scenery. It becomes really quiet and I hear this strange sound. Like a machine starting up. And I remember seeing a huge, marble colored head coming towards me from behind the grass. Then a flash of white light. All of a sudden, the sun was about to go down and I walk towards the temple. Immediately these temple guards start running to me asking me where I’ve been or whatever. There was nobody at the temple anymore. Just me and the guards being nice and trying to ask where I’ve been. Growing up, every once in a while this memory would always come back, like a broken record playing the same song. Nothing strange ever happened to me after that until I was 16. I was in my bedroom (now in the US) and I had woken up just before the sun rose and see a strange thin figure with a big head in front of my window. I couldn’t move my body anymore and the blinding light and the same strange sound from my memory. When I came to, I was sitting up on my bed looking straight out my window feeling well rested. I’m in my early 20s now and sometimes I’m lying in bed and hear that strange machine-like noise and wake up the next day, always facing the window, sitting up. Has anybody experienced something like this? If you don’t believe me just please leave the page, but I just want to know if there’s anybody out there who’s experiencing these things too.
