 I just had a crazy dream.  I crashed a secret society meeting in the  astral.  I tried a few times to get in and just look evil but it didn't  work.  Some of the people there could sense my energy and could tell I   wasn't evil.  So I tried a spell to surround myself with dark energy.    But that didn't work.  They still could tell I wasn't evil.  So then  someone there took me up to the top of the roof where I fought a dragon.    I used a spell to hold the dragon with a magical chain that I  conjured.  The dragon scribbled three words of power (like from skyrim)   on the top of the roof.  And I learned it.  Apparently it involved   turning some guy into a mental vegetable and using his dark energy to  fool the psychics.  And it worked for about twenty minutes.  Until one  of them got too close and could see that I wasn't evil.  The past few  times they caught me crashing their meeting they had someone throw me  out.  This time I wasn't sure if they would do that.  So I teleported  out of there.  I did a bunch of short range teleports until I was  outside.  I don't know if this was a wild dream or if I really did crash  a secret society meeting in the astral.  But those psychics were really  good.  They could sense almost immediately that I wasn't evil.  I had  to memory wipe one of their people and siphon off his negative energy  and even that only fooled them for a few minutes.  Also I could sense  the kind of energy the psychics were looking for.  It's like the kind of  energy you would get from a total psychopath who has no empathy.  It  was really distorted and screwed up energy.  Also I remember before this  having an OBE.  And being on the lookout for negative entities.  I  thought I was dead.  And I wasn't going to let them try to get me to  reincarnate.  Maybe I ended up in that meeting because I was focusing on  them.  Who know.s  So was this just a crazy dream or did I really crash  some secret society party in the astral?
