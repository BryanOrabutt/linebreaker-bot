Well long story short I have serious depression and pretty much cope with numerous addictions from sex/drugs/alcohol and everything else you can think of it mainly started when I was 12 and got worse as time progressed I was neglected as a teen and basically homeless I was molested for years when I was barely 3 or 4 and I’ve never really had a break things hit it’s worst when I lost my first kid at 18 then went through hell and back because the girl I had lost the kid with took it out on me even tho it was something medical she physically abused me and verbally well I just took it why not I was on so many drugs at the time and being the biggest man hoe you could imagine I couldn’t go a second without something well life fucked me and she got pregnant again but it stuck and I was excited and things looked up for me but no she was this monster and she took off while she was pregnant to spite me and gave me the promise of getting to be in my kids life well it was bs she told all my friends and most my family that I had beat her and raped her when I did no such thing and everyone believed her I was no where near to back up myself up and got delt the shit end of the stick well she gave birth and teased me with my kid sent pics here and there then disappeared I was already in such a shit state I was huge alcoholic and drank 24/7 she would continue this for few years and even after moving closer so I can finally meet my son I was give 5 miserable minutes with him all while getting degraded and stuff in front of him and just bunch bs then off she was again things spun out and I was drinking and popping pills left and right not to long after I got in some mess with my brother cuz he went and jacked all my stuff from my house cuz he was a dick I persuaded him to come over to get high and as soon as he got in distance I beat the fuck outta him my older “thug “brother was completely pumbled and he had my father and grandmother mad at me because family doesn’t do that etc etc needless to say I was mad and packed up and left last thing me and my dad talked bout was pretty much arguing and telling me to be kind to him because he doesn’t know better yep ..so I moved and stayed to myself for most part and life came crashing down again..this time my father was diagnosed with cancer and had maybe a year left this effected me a lot and I was just getting settled in to my new place and job and had planned to go stay at hospital with him  for bit we talked every day and I was promised so much and my worries were put to rest a bit well my phone ended up running outta service and I didn’t get paid for another 2 weeks I had no way of getting ahold of him and my bday was coming so one my buddies turned my phone on And I was flooded with messages and missed calls turns out my father passed on my bday and I just lost it still makes me tear up thinking about that exact moment...worst of all the funeral was a bunch of drama and my baby mama ended up being there for some reason and I got to see my son for first time in years my grandma forced me to get close to them I was not wanting to but I did and felt something for once and was genuinely happy I was promised more time if I stayed few extra days in town well I stayed 2 weeks and not one call or visit I spent 20 hrs on a greyhound back home and I was in the worst mood ..got home and began coping ..well alcohol was my buddy until some co workers turned me onto coke and meth ,coke was my stuff for most part id run through a 8ball every other day plus I shared with sum friends just to “keep “ there company eventually coke wasn’t enough for the depression and pain I had and I turned to meth originally meth was a once a month thing since it was so intense but quickly I replaced coke and stuck with meth ever since I was hardcore on it binging for months and combining all sorts things and snorting and smoking it like nothing I was hardcore on it for 2 years ended up In hospital numerous times and struggled to get sober at first I’d go a week or 2 then come back and binge in the worse way eventually I got to the lowest point and I hated meth but had todo it even tho I was getting nothing from it but I was able to get sober and stay sober for almost a year literally days shy of it then a old buddy came on the anniversary of my dads death and well I caved in and broke it I would get fucked up for few weeks then quit in a huge struggle I would throw my stuff away and start with withdrawals I did this nearly every few months then got into pills yet again and Then again got sober yet again then got on meth again ended in the hospital recently since my tolerance was low I was hitting it like if I was on it constant and stopped for good while but recently have struggled again and used for a week threw away my stuff in anger and disgust then week later back on it and this is kinda were I’m at currently been a week and been up for most of it I neglected to mention a lot of other issues but it’s not really important I guess plus it took effort to even open up now..I’m in a shit mood due to arguing with my wife and all this bs and I’m close to just dropping everything and going or just snorting my whole bag it’s a pretty big sac I planned to be positive instead of negative I had a solid plan to get sober and stay sober I don’t wanna die and don’t wanna use it’s almost like breathing it just happens worst of all when there’s so much negativity and bs to deal with I was doing good living off a bump or 2 a day I was happy I started new job and felt confident and happy and was sticking to my plan for sobriety I was taking what I learned from numerous times of use and withdrawals etc and really tried to do better I couldn’t just go cold turkey couldn’t afford to sleep for days and recover so slowly I was wheening myself so withdrawals didn’t take such a toll and it wouldn’t effect work but bs happened and no matter what I said or anything it was disgarded because it was to much of a burden for her 1-I’m not bad or ugly on stuff Im very happy and productive I accomplished months of work that had to b done to our house in 3 days and even took my wife out and spoiled her  2-she told me to be honest and open up to her because the way she can be I hide when I fuck up and use and only tell her once I wanted to get rid my stuff and be clean just to have some support she can be very ugly and make things worse so I keep to myself and only have myself as support and what not to get sober  but apparently all I do is talk about drugs and bs everything she said was bullshit and wouldn’t even let me talk because a druggy is a druggy and will make excuses I’ve never had the need to I’m the most open person I’ve told plenty I’ve done drugs and struggle with addiction its nun to brag bout but I’m honest it’s nice to get props for coming a long way but yeah it was a cluster fuck so I gave in and I was that druggy I broke my plan and I’ve take lines every few hours I don’t get nun from it it’s pointless but it helps the pain just lil and I’ll take what I can get ..I pretty much ignored her after the argument and struggled not to give in but I did and I stayed to myself until I had to go to work I wasn’t even excited to go I was all fucked up and didn’t care then received all these texts from her at work  and how’s she’s done and all this stuff cuz it’s a stress on her and she has to be there for me all of it’s bs because she zones me out when I try talking I don’t even come to her cuz I know the outcome and she made everything about her but nothing was valid so I’ve used more than I have in forever I got past a point of fear and more less like fuck it I looked up a drug help group thingy because I didn’t want this def at the extent I’m going I want help it’s very hard to do it alone and so I told her few hours ago that I’m going to go to one but she got mad because I need something other than her it was another cluster fuck and I snorted half my bag and now I’m here typing so I don’t focus on my chest bursting I’m sorry to bore anyone with this I’m just talking and opening I’m not one those proud users I find it stupid that I was when I was at my worse I’ve learned and grown but can’t escape addiction especially since I know what works best for me I’ve come along way just to fuck up again and feel like shit and just wanna be high and happy but can’t achieve neither ugh I’m sorry for this I’m gonna go smoke and try not todo another line ...
