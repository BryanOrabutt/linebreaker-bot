This one is bugging me.                                                                                                                                                         ORLANDO, Fla. — Three newborn babies found abandoned years apart at a Florida apartment complex are all siblings, DNA testing has shown. Back in 2016 a newborn baby was abandoned outside an apartment at the Willow Key Apartments in Orlando. Another baby was abandoned at the complex in 2017 and it happened again last summer.  Orlando Police Department investigators said they have determined that all three babies have the same mother and father. \*From what I am reading the Baby in 2017 was a girl and the first and last ( 2016 and 2019) were both boys.                                                                                                                                                            A  note left next to the abandoned boy said: "I had him in the bathroom alone. His dad tried to kill us. Please keep him secret and take him to hospital. Dad a very dangerous man. I’m so sorry. I tried to clean him and feed him."

She seems to show remorse and cares for the babies. Cleaning them up, feeding them etc. I would not be surprised to find out that she lives there in the complex or somewhere close by as this has become the dumping grounds 3 times. I keep picturing a scare mother having just given birth running out and leaving her baby. The fear, the worry. Its heart wrenching. Something about that complex is really bothering me and I cant put my finger on what. I tried to search the area for other infamous crimes, to figure out what about that complex is nagging at me and came up empty handed other than a case where a man shot his 16 year old ex girlfriend ( Kwantedious Lamont Ross age 19)  but I checked on that case and he received life and is still in jail ( that wasn't what was nagging me but I followed the rabbit down the hole  to the dead end)   Also- Jennifer Kesse (disappearance ) happened only 3 miles away, so perhaps that was it.  Such a coincidence. To happen so close. The babies are obviously bi-racial but that doesn't mean that she couldnt be held captive by someone of a different race. He could be forcing her to write the notes. The notes appear articulate, well written. Maybe the Father is forcing the Mother to write them and then abandoning them?  SO fellow Redditors- thoughts? Facts? Theories?
