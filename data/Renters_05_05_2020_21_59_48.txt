I’ve been renting a room (more of a patio with sliding doors) out of a house month to month in Los Angeles from a frugal but usually fair landlord. He lives in the garage in the same house. Before I moved in, he warned me that the ceiling would leak from time to time when it rains (which was at the time an uncommon occurrence in LA). Because it’s more of patio than a room it gets very hot and very cold, but I didn’t mind because of the good price. Over time, it started to rain. The leaks grew from one spot to many spots and progressively got worse every “rainy season”. I would let the landlord know and he would always provide a band aid solution that would help for a bit but then things would quickly go back to how they were. It became apparent that he didn’t want to pour any money into the roof if he didn’t have to. I sometimes would like to have a guest visit or stay overnight and it was impossible to do if it was raining and leaking from multiple areas of the ceiling. I sent my landlord a text asking if there was a permanent solution and he said he would see what he could do. He finally realized that I was serious about the problem and called in some professionals that fixed up the roof for a couple grand. After it was finished I was notified by my landlord that he would be increasing my rent by 25% in 30 days. I was taken aback as this was obviously not mentioned before he decided to fix the roof. I told him this couldn’t have come at a worse time as I was recently furloughed from my job (I may return June 1 but am taking my employer’s word with a grain of salt). He said he would give me some time to “get back up on my feet” but as far as he’s concerned the room will he now costing what he calls “market value”. I’m open to a rent increase, I just think 25% is too steep given the situation. I haven’t told the other renters in the house and I don’t really have anyone to talk with about this so I would love to hear your opinions. Am I being selfish?
