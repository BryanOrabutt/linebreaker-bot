I’ve only ever experienced a major death in my life once before and it was sudden.... My Pappa’s health deteriorated fast but I knew he wouldn’t have a whole lot of time left when we found out his diagnosis.... he died a week and a half after finding out it was terminal. He went from being active and working in his shop to not being able to walk or move by himself and then passing in less than 2 weeks...... somehow it felt like forever and all of a sudden.... at the same time. My Pappa used to be out of town for oil fields all the time so I grew up being used to it just being my Grandma around the house. It also means I’m much closer with her. I’m used to seeing his things around the house even though he isn’t there. In part this feels like that..... like he’s just put of town and I’m not sure when he’ll be back but that he will be. I know that isn’t true but..... it certainly feels that way. In the days leading up to his death every time I saw an older white man in overalls my heart skipped a beat thinking it was him (which is often when you work at a Walmart in the midwest). I cried and was crushed when I found out but.... ultimately glad he was no longer in pain. He was in so much pain for the months leading up to his death. Even before he showed it to us. I mostly feel numb now.... empty. Trying to clean my house and continue with my life like things are normal. They almost feel normal.... as normal as it can now, I guess, during this pandemic. We have no idea when we’ll be able to hold a funeral. Makes it feel even less real. Seeing my Grandma is heartbreaking. I’m terrified that without him she is going to lose her will to live. She’s like a second mother to me, I was over at her house constantly growing yo after my parents divorced and my mom had to work 3 jobs to support us. As much as I’m crushed over my Pappa I just know it would be worse if she went so soon too. I always thought I’d have longer with them....
