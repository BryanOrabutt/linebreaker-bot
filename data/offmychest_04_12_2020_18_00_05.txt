Lately, I am so jealous of how easily people fall in and out of love. This might come off as weirdly self-praising but I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same way?? I think I have such a unique world view, from most people anyway. I am a skeptic and rarely give people the benefit of the doubt. And this spills into my romantic life. I have pretty much selected all of my boyfriends since I was a teenager. I have always known who I want, and when I am done, I always know who I want next. So I haven't had to deal with many situation-ships or one night stands or 'flings'. Recently, I went through a breakup and in a week he was already talking to another girl, two weeks later I literally run into them on a date. So I go against my instinct I took a date with someone who had been crushing on me for years, the date was fun and nice, we talked for about 2 weeks after but I dreaded it to the very end. I dreaded every phone call, every text, the stupid pet names. It all felt so insincere. The guy is nice and probably would be a good partner but I just don't want HIM. And I don't care. I feel like everyone is looking for love wherever they can find it, and I am doing things in reverse. I am looking for a specific person and I only want THEIR love. I don't want love from anyone who is just good enough. I watch my friends just easily jump in and out of flings and relationships and it seems so so easy for them. I kind of envy that because to me a person could literally be perfect but I know I am going to be single for a while because currently I only want love from ONE person specifically. I am at such a tug of war with that idea. I wonder if this makes me lose out on good guys, or on dating experiences that would maybe grow me? And then sometimes I am proud of myself for being so strong-minded. For being in such control of my romantic choices. Anyway, does this resonate with anyone?
