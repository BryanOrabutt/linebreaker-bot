Ok so I wake up the other morning to see my beloved ranger missing from my front yard obviously it was drug out and whoever did it left a big mess behind stone all over my sidewalk for some unknown reason my front bumper was removed from the truck and left laying in my yard now the truck has 0 citations on it no fines or anything never was mailed anything and never had  any Citations on the stuck on the truck. After talking to my neighbor he noticed my truck on a rollback as he was heading to work the rollback was entering the towns police impound around 5am that morning  after finding this out we called local pd and after being ran around being told the officer that had information about my truck already clocked out and wasnt back on duty till monday now mind you its Saturday around noon and they tell me nobody can help me so I have to wait till monday to call again so Monday rolls in I call and the officer that's supposed to be the only one supposedly to have information for me has no clue what I'm even talking about so he says let me call you back I'll find out the officer who should be in charge of this. After waiting all day finally get a call back with more bs the officer who is in charge of it wont be in till Wednesday call back then so Wednesday comes I call finally ths asshole that towed my truck from my own private property answers the phone I tell him I want to know what reason did they have coming on my property and illegally towing my truck I wanna know where my truck is and he tells me he towed it for a mysterious citation that I never recieved or could find on public records of 125 dollars that wasnt paid and that's why they took it and also notes that I need to pay 175 for the tow 125 for the citation and add 25 for eack day it was in their storage since they received it and then states after me paying all these fees and showing him a paid receipt for it all only then he would tell me where my truck was at and hed only release the truck to a tow truck and I could not drive it at all now they towed the truck Saturday and it already 5pm Wednesday so if I want my truck I gotta come up with 425 if I want it today and find a tow truck and pay for that so I ask him what the citation was for what was the truck doing wrong that he had to give it a citation but fail to inform its owner about it he was silent for a few seconds and said mr.**** I told you what you had to do to get your truck back do what I told you bring the money  to borough building with a tow truck and I'll release the truck I said what was the citation for he said if ya dont want this to happen again pay your citations and you wont have this problem and hung up. So that leaves me nowhere I'm currently unemployed do to the covid-19 I have 16 dollars to my name and that's to pay my electric bill so I'm left feeling like I'm screwed I need help what can I do
