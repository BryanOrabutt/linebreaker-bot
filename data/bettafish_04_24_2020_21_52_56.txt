Hi! I bought my third betta fish back on March 17 2020,  the other fish that I’ve had, I was younger and just thought they were pretty and never went further than feeding them daily, which I regret. Since I got my new fish, Vibe, I regret not taking care of my other fish the way I do Vibe because I find a lot of joy in it and cleaning his tank, feeding him, watching him swim around are things I look forward to everyday now. When I first got Vibe, I bought a 3.5 gallon tank, rocks for the bottom, some live plants (which i’ve never used before in my fish tanks), and a little hide for him to go in. I’ve been changing the water and rinsing out the tank every 2 weeks, using half of the water from before to balance it out and using new purified water for the other half, then conditioning it with water conditioner for bettas. Today, I threw out the live plants because they were making the water really dirty and I’ve decided to get him some new plastic plants, which I’ll be doing soon. I also looked up proper care, and his water is supposed to be between 78-80 degrees, which today when I refilled his tank I made sure that it was 79 degrees. I feed him everyday at around 1:30-2 pm, turn his led lights on at 9 am, turn them off at 9 pm, and clean his tank the same way every other week. So my concern and where I’m in need of advice (feel free to tell me if anything I’m doing is wrong)... I looked up why his fins looked ripped up or stuck together, I’ll try to insert a picture into this if I can figure out how. One thing said that it was because his water was too cold, which is why today I added a thermometer to his tank to measure the temperature of his water. So, if that is the case, how long will it take for his fins to go back to normal? He’s a really pretty fish and he adds a lot of joy to my day. I want to do everything I can to keep him happy and healthy, but I need some advice. What can I fix about his schedule? What can I do to fix his fins?
