Last week on Tuesday, I spoke to my sister (f18), who still lives with my np. Everything has been getting worse at home due to this pandemic. The main problem is my np have been drinking. She has been calling me as a support system. Then on Thursday afternoon, she texted me. She said “hello.” Not long after, she texted “two days ago, I ran away from home.” And like me, she was involved in argument with my drunk np. My nstepfather then verbally targeted her. He kept trying to put words in her mouth. I’m proud that my sister stood up for herself then let him say rude things about her. In result, he told her “to get the fuck out of my face.” My sister packed her bag and left. My shitty nstepfather took her phone and computer when she was leaving. With no phone or light and just a packed bag, she left. To make things worse, she told me that a car was trying to purposely hit her in the middle of the night. She is okay. Her arm broke the side mirror and that car was never seen again. All of This was past 11pm. Honestly, I’ve been so upset since I found out. Ive been crying, scared and filled with anger. I can’t believe my np did this again but to my sister. She went back to living with them. It makes me sick that they didn’t even care or cry when she told them about the car. Neither did they actually apologize for their actions.... At this point, I don’t know what to do. I’m even more angry at my own mother for letting nstepfather do this to my whole family since he came into our lives... it’s not fair to my siblings. And It’s not fair that he play these psychology games, fucking with our minds. I feel so hopeless. I have moved out of that miserable home but it seems like I still can’t live my own life happily. The reason for it is because I always think about my siblings. My nstepfather has displayed me as a “bad influence” to my siblings, trying to turn them against me. It’s even harder to even stay in contact with my siblings because of how much he doesn’t want them using their phones in the house (“it’s disrespectful and family should be first”). The situation is so complex. But one thing I know is that it’s not fair for my siblings to see and deal with my np... I don’t know know what to do. I wish I could just grab take my siblings but even I can’t support all of them. And Depending on other family to take care of them is unreliable too.... I’ve truly met a mastered narcissist and seen how he has destroyed my family with constant fear and pain.... Thank for listening.😔
