So I don’t exactly know where to put this but I have been dealing with this account for almost 2 years. I would put a screenshot of this account but it would give away my actual name and the school I go to and I want to try to be as vague as possible in this (I am also using a throwaway account because people who know about this know about my personal account). So this started last year and I found out that there’s this account and they’re going around messaging people pretending to be me and I also found out this account was made during the summer. I didn’t know what to do at the time cause this account obviously knows my name, the school I go to, my music taste, and vines that I used to quote all the time back then, which doesn’t sound like much now that I think about it but they used my music taste and the vines I quote as like a way to sound more similar to me so people would be convinced that it’s actually me with an alternate account. At first instead of being reasonable I spammed whoever this was because I was stupid at the time and because of my reaction they kept the account. This account would also message me saying “hi me” and stuff similar to that I have also asked them to stop before which they said no and continue to impersonate me. I have reported this account multiple times back then but it has not been taken down. About 2 months ago they messaged me again and I thought nothing of it but someone who was bored and just wanted to mess with people but today I went to block the account since I wanted to make my account public and I don’t need this person to screenshot my posts and put them as their own and I noticed they updated the bio to the school I’m going to now. It’s fine if you don’t believe this cause at the time when it started I also thought this couldn’t be real and I’m confused if this counts as stalking or someone just being creepy, if this is harassment or not and what I should do because I do have an idea of a person who is behind it but I am not friends with them anymore and I don’t know how to confront them without making this person upset and probably making this situation worse.
