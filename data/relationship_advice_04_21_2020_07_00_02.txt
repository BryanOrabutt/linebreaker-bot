So I want to preface this by saying I'm in no way trying to brag or sound cool, just genuinely seeking advice. I need advice on what to say and how to handle a one sided attraction. A little back story, I (26M) just got out of a \~9 year relationship with my girlfriend in high school around the begging of December (her choice). An issue I'm having is being with a girl, hooking up, having fun etc and her developing feelings. Normally that wouldn't be a bad thing, but for me personally I have no desire to date anyone for at least a while. Furthermore I have had conversations with her about not wanting to date and she said the same (she brought it up first). However she ended up wanting more.  I am definitely to blame, I'm still in relationship mode being all cuddly and lovey. Acting like I'm still in a relationship, which I now know isn't helping my case. What I need advice on is how can I tell her that I don't want to be an item or be official. I really do like this girl and she's part of our friend group which makes is harder / more delicate of a problem. I do get to flirty and default to relationship mode. That is something I have to work on and i know that. I've had this problem before and I come out looking like the bad guy even though I made it clear I don't want to be with anyone and did everything to avoid being an asshole. What can I do to again let her know I do not want a relationship etc? Better yet, what are some things I should not do or say that might come across that I'm wanting more?  Like I said at the beginning, I know this may come off sounding douchey and like I'm an ashhole, but that is exactly what I want to avoid. Any advice on how to broach this subject would be much appreciated. Also is there a better way to tell a girl at the begging that I don't want anything serious or more than a fling. Sorry if this is long, I'm just not good with talking / feelings in person and I don't want to become the bad guy or an asshole.
