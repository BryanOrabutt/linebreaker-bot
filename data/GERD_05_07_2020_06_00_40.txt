I'm 22(male) and up until recently I've felt fine. I've had heartburn for a while but just took tums to alleviate. But now idk if I caught a stomach bug or something but for a week I've been nauseous and have had thin stools with mucus and when I wipe its yellow(sorry if tmi). Also when I vomit it's always clear bile. Anxiety has picked up especially since everywhere I read it says stomach flu/food poisoning only last around 3 to 4 days and it's been a week with these symptoms. The first 2 days it just felt like I had gas stuck under my ribs,not painful, but felt as tho i needed to let it out, the rest went as stated above. No severe cramps or blood in my stool but that could be because I'm catching it early I'm thinking. Went to the drs yesterday but obviously I was told that I'm too young and showed no signs of serious damage. Also showed the dr a mole on my back that concerned me and was told that it looks concerning but to visit a dermatologist only if it starts oozing or getting larger. Ughh and now I look at my gums and see that there's some black spots which worries me that I have cancer and that its spreading, I know that might not be exactly how it works but my brains going a mile a minute and I cant stay off Google for more than 5 minutes..I've been pressing down on my stomach all night trynna see if anything feels abnormal but I ain't a damn dr lol. Been looking at people's stories for hours now and have came to the conclusion that I'll never know until I get some test done, which might not even be possible because I have NO INSURANCE! I could be overreacting  but I just want peice of mind that itll be all right ya know? I thought I'd gain that after visiting the docs but all she did was push on my stomach and ask questions .. 200$ only to still be unsure whether I have it or not, I've seen plenty of stories saying the dr misdiagnosed and feel like the same could've happened to me. I ate soup earlier, and 5 min later I puked it up. Any ideas ?
