Season ends in the Eredivisie and Ajax are crowned champions of the league, last game of the season saw Waalwijk facing Heerenveen in a 0-2 loss for the team in blue and yellow. It has been a great season for them as they were and expected mid-table side at the beggining of the year, but 14 goals from star striker Dylan Vente along with 7 goals and 15 assist(league high) for the young Rybalka carried the team up the league ranks, they ended up finishing 6th, one spot shy of Europa League football next season, but the fans are delighted. Øyvind Rybalka was selected for the Eredivisie team of the season, being the only player from RKC Waalwijk to do so, a phenomenal season for the young gun, now being called "Cowboy" by the supporters because of his precision with the ball, some clubs in the big leagues are sniffing around for this player and are going to try their best to bring him in, rumours float around about a possible Ajax transfer, but Southampton, Lyon and Mönchengladbach are reportedly interested in the Norwegian aswell. He spoke with one of our reporters after the last game of the season, and he had some words for the fans: "I want to thank everyone at the club for this, mostly Fred(the manager), he believed in me from the get go and allowed me to play my game the way I wanted, and the result show that it was a great idea, we should look forward to next season as one of confirmation, to show every team in the country that we belong in the higher tiers of club level". When talking about a possible transfer, he said: "I'm not thinking too much about it, I believe in this team and I want to focus on my time here, but I can't ignore any of my possibilities". Next season will be important for the young norwegian, will he go out of the Netherlands? Will he bring succes to RKC Waalwijk next season? Or will he and his team flop? Those are questions that need to be answered on the football pitch in the 20-21 season, until then, we'll be here, waiting to hopefully see the birth of a star.
