I was in a car accident where I held a little girl while she slowly died in my arms... this was within hours after I got raped. I went for a hike and a women had gotten high and drove and crashed into an elderly couple. I went to my brothers state swim meet and had recently gotten an interview from Microsoft so I thought it was the best day ever and wanted to spend it with my friends when I got back into my college town. Yet when I got got back I got raped by the door man of a fraternity while I was sober because I was a nice women who wanted to understand why the doorman was upset. He pulled me upstairs shoved me in a closet and basically had his way with me. The day after I wanted to clear my head so I went on a hike and went out on the road even though I had 3 hard tests to study for; physics II, Circuits, Calculus III. So that Sunday I was hiking and all was good until I hit a car crash. I was the first person to get to the crash on the back country road and the closest hospital was 50 minutes away. The first thing I checked was the driver and she was evidently high so even though she was yelling in pain I checked on her children. Her son was fine but her daughter had metal from the truck intercepting her leg. I was too weak from the night beforehand to tell the hill billies that showed up to the scene that ‚Äúas a man‚Äù they where wrong so they ended up pulling her out of the crash. That girl ended up bleeding out on the side of the road while what the men thought was a scene waiting to blow up never blew up... The mother lived and so did the son. The car the high mother hit was an elderly couple. The women in the passenger side was severely injured. Eventually they got a evacuation helicopter to come to the scene and the ambulance showed up... but yet that wasn‚Äôt enough to save the girl that was bleeding out from the truck or my innocence from the night before... üò≠
