I’ve been with my girlfriend a little over a year. I have just started this SR journey in December but have not been able to make it past 9 days. My girlfriend and I have are both in high school, we hangout a couple times a week and have sex whenever we hangout. I’ve been doing Kegels/reverse kegels and pelvic floor stretches but just can’t seem to hold my nut back it always comes out. I’ve been practicing kegels/reverse kegels for about 2 months using the app Stamena and I have been stretching for about 2 weeks. I don’t have premature ejaculation but I have been Doing this so I can stay on the same sex schedule with my Shorty just without releasing so I can make it past 9 days. I’ve been able to have sex with my girl without releasing but eventually it’s like the pressure is too much and I release. Why doesn’t it seem like my pelvic floor muscles are getting any stronger? I’ve heard people been able to fuck their girl and have a non ejaculatory orgasm and be able to keep going while holding their Nut in still how do you do this? How long does it take until you notice your pelvic floor muscles getting stronger? Also, I was on a streak of 8 days on Thursday right before Valentine’s Day I was going on 9 days then me and my girl go on a date of course we go out to eat, go to a movie then go back to the crib and get to fucking and boom after like 7 minutes I felt it coming and I told her I need to slow down I feel like I’m about to cum then she said it’s Valentine’s Day so cum and I did then we went again but I felt so drained and then the next day Saturday we had sex again and I released again then Sunday we didn’t hangout so I got another day, then Monday night (4 day weekend) we had sex again and I released again, now it’s Tuesday and I didn’t release but I edged this morning for like an hour idk what’s going on But I hate this shit 🤦‍♂️ Please help me Out
