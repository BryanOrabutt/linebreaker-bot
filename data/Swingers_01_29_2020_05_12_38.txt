Where to start. A few years back, my wife tells me she missed no strings attached sex. She asked if we could come to some sort of agreement so to speak. We settled on the “the doors being open” as we called it. Basically each of us were allowed to have interactions with out the other. I won’t lie at first I was really angry. (Some back story, a few weeks prior I caught her messaging and flirting with a guy we work with) Now, this is where it gets interesting. Our sex life went from her being super vanilla to the greatest sex I have personally ever had. It was like opening the doors made her a crazy nypho. There were moments that I didn’t have anything lined up that I would be jealous that she was out fucking someone else. Then she would come home and tell me all about it and I would get super turned on. Or vice versa. I would be out and come home and she wanted every detail while I fucked her. We had a lot of separate encounters and ended up in a MFF 3 way with a close friend of both of ours. (The friend and I continued to play alone after). Fast forward a year, and she has stopped going out and has asked that we “close the doors”.  Now at first I was fine with that, I didn’t want them open to begin with, but now a few years later and our sex life is back to the worse vanilla sex I’ve ever had. Occasionally we will dirty talk about our encounters and her body just reacts and she goes in this mode. I’ve mentioned several times about “opening the doors” back up, but she brushes it off and says, “I don’t want that to be who we are as a couple.” I don’t want that being the reason we are together. Now I’m left wishing we were still in the LS. It’s like she can’t be the nympho with the doors closed, they go hand in hand. What do I do??? We have talked and talked about this and she always says I will work on my drive. But it’s been a couple years. 😕
