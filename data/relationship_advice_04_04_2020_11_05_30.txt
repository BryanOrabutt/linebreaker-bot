   im very sorry, i know this is long and stupid! :(                                                                                                                                                                                    theres this guy that i have been talking too, online. i genuinely like him. ( i know everyone thinks online relationships arent real or some shit but i cant help it ) everytime we talk i just feel comfortable and warm. i know that he is talking to other girls, and i feel bad for feeling jealous. the thing is, he told me he likes the chase... but i have no idea if he even sees me in that way because it feels like hes literally talking to me like one of the boys! not that i mind, i like to know that he is comfortable enough with me to do so. but i can help this feeling. we were talking earlier and he was asking me a bunch of questions trying to get to know me and he asked if i think edating was real, and i said "well i feel like its different for everybody, some people can handle it and some cant" and he just said no no they arent real. BUT LISTEEEN GUYS. he was "egirl" hunting because he was bored from all this quarantine shit, saying hes tired of hearing other guys voices so he started talking to me. he says "all i need is a female voice" , and he was looking to occupy the spot. me being silly i offered and he said that i may have taken the spot after talking for awhile. ive never felt like this before and im too scared to say anything because i feel like he might unadd me again! ( he unadded me off snap and discord before ) yall im so confused i dunno how to make him open up to the chance of frickin edating. i know i sound stupid because lord knows i am.
