So I'm 17 years old, turning 18 this year. I worked as a lifeguard over the summer and plan on becoming a doctor. That's enough about me. My mom I'm pretty sure is bipolar, one minute she loves me, the other she despises me. My dad is not the brightest person, and causes a lot of problems for my mom. In turn my mom relies heavily on me to help her out. She constantly looks for a reason to get mad, yelling at me for the smallest of shit. My dad got laid off during this Corona epidemic, so we filed for unemployment, and I was supposed to file each week. I filed last week for my dad since he's computer illiterate but the money didn't come on Monday. My mom flipped, cursing at me and saying shit how I'm useless, how she regrets having me, how I can't do anything, an how she wishes she could kill herself. She has literally grounded me to one meal per day, and told me that when this epidemic blows over she will take out the equivalent amount of money that didn't come out of my bank account since its shared with her cause I'm not 18 yet. Best part is, we have a decent amount of money, it's not like we're living paycheck to paycheck. I cannot wait until I leave this household, but the path I'm taking in life (medicine) is nowhere near cheap and I need every cent I can get. I've reached the point where I don't care if I live another day or not, due to the lack of mental and physical support, I was looking forward this summer to working so I could get away from her since I work like 50-60 hours a week by my own choice, but even that doesn't seem like an option. Thanks to the mental abuse of my mom where I would get grounded if I got anything less than a 90, I feel little to no empathy for others as well and it scares me. So I wanted to ask, what advice should I take lol, I was considering air force to cover the costs of being a doctor but I lack the balls to do it on my own, plus when I get out where will I go? Thanks for reading my long request for help lmao
