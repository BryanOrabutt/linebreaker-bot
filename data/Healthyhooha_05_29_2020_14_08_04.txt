I know this isnâ€™t a ttc page but my hooha issues have been on blast since weâ€™ve starting trying for a baby. Short history:  got my first bv and yeast infection freshman year of college when I started having regular sex with my boyfriend at the time. I am now in my early 30â€™s and have had BV many time since then , pretty spread out though. I donâ€™t really get yeast infections. Basically any time I ever had a new partner I would get bv and then would be fine (except with my bf later in college who was uncircumcised. I got like 2 or 3 infections before my body adjusted.) Fast forward to this past January when we started our awesome (sarcasm) ttc journey. I have gotten 3 and possibly 4 bv infections since Jan. I would understand if it was one time since my body needs to get used to semen. But every single time after ovulation I notice I start smelling different and then it turns into fishiness. As we know after ovulation is such a crucial and fragile part of conceiving and we know that Bv can prevent all of the important things from happening, or even kill sperm before they Can reach the egg. I feel so helpless at the moment. This morning I woke up and again Iâ€™m smelling different. Not horrible yet.. but itâ€™s def different and not the best smell. We had sex 4 days ago so I donâ€™t think my ph is still balancing itself. We only had sex ONCE this month to try to prevent this .. which is also not making our chances of conceiving any better.  Iâ€™m also wondering- what If my ph is always off balance and I just donâ€™t always have symptoms? Then I will def never get pregnant. I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this if it happens every month... and I feel helpless and alone. I know that sounds dramatic but everyone around me is getting pregnant and I canâ€™t help but ask... why canâ€™t my body handle this? I needed to get that off my chest and I know my husband would just worry so I didnâ€™t want to complain to him again this month. Thank you for reading ðŸ˜”
