 I forgive  you all for  you  know  not what you do to  give  insight into  my  life I am  young  adult  with  asperger's syndrome  that  motivates me, especialto  act,and  react to  certain  things that  trigger my  sensibilities as an  individual  that  prompt me to  pursue certain  courses of  action that I  feel are  right, along with  a blatant  distrust of  authority  figures  much less  anyone  claiming to be  so, much less  I detest being  challenged to the point my  blood  literally  feels like  its boiling, an  uncomfortable  sensation. As I  explained in my  introductory post I switched from  video  games to the  sanctity of the  tabletop gaming  where I  go out and  interact with people who  I  can  socialize with  whom are  on my  level  as an  individual  because I've been a  huge  nerd  since  8 years old  which  I  got  bullied for  in  school  because I  had  an  actual  brain on  top of  God  blessing me  with a  massive  growth  spurt  allowing me to  tower over  my  classmates, allowing me to  intimidate my  bullies  who are  now  suffering  karmic retribution for  their  bullying now  one  now suffering life in  Scottsdale  one of the worst  places in my  perspective where they are  probably  dealing with  snobbery  on a daily basis. Anyway I  recently  experienced a  stroke last  year in  July rendering me  paralyzed  on my  left side. I believe in  fighting the  good fight  because  I  want to  improve  humanity which is why I am  pursuing an education in  psychology  to  help  those  suffering from  crippling addictions,and and  help those who  need help, for  I dream of the future  where  humanity  faces  no  strife hardships,or  oppression from  petty inane  shenanigans, a future  I hope  comes to  true  so  my  children,and my  descendants  can  experience  paradise  without fear. One  thing I  shall  agree with  you on is that  I  should  read,and  know more of the  bible, just to be  fair. Now  one  thing  I  request in  turn is that  you  lot  cool it  on the racist, nazi,and  fascist  accusations  that's  the  sort of thing  someone  can  suit for  on the  basis of  slander,but  people  could  easily  accuse you all of hypocrisy, when  you're  posting  memes  depicting  Hitler and swastikas on a  consistent basis  to the  point  you'd  likely  attract  the  aryan brotherhood to the  subreddit thinking that the  subreddit  loves  Hitler and  fascism. Please  remove the  disgusting  gamer  flair  off  me  instead  replace it  with  nerd, a more  apt  description of  me  since  I  derive  more  satisfaction from  tabletop than  a console, when I am  not out  horseback riding, or  playing with  my  filly,and  training  her  by  racing against her on my  power mobility  scooter
