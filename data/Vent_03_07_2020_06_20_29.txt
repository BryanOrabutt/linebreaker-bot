Up until the age of 8 my Aunts spoiled my sister and I as they had no children of their own, I always loved having our family so close. But one day that all changed, my cousin was born. I was really excited about having a little cousin to play with and teach, to begin with everything was great! But then my other Aunt had a kid too. And young me began to realize that now they had their own kids my sister and I were no longer of any use to them. Before long I would only see them at Christmas, they still sent birthday presents though so that was nice. But then everything came crashing down when I was 10, My aunt (The eldest one of the 3) died. That leads into a whole other story. Our family began to fragment before my eyes, my Mum was understandably heartbroken. This soon turned to anger as my 2 Aunts immediately after the funeral began fighting about inheritance and how my dead aunts share in a property should be theirs (it was to be slit equally between them as stated in their fathers will) my Mum distanced us from them as they were toxic. I had hoped that maybe by Christmastime things would be okay (it wasnt) and we didnt attend. Then over the years the birthday presents slowly stopped coming. The last time I saw them was 4 years ago in a legal battle between my Mum and a bad bad man(its a long story but any horrible that can be done to a woman he did to her for years) the Aunts sided with him... It makes me so angry thinking about all they have done. Now I am studying hard for my last year of highschool and so far have gotten only 100% and A's, my own plan of revenge is to succeed in life and one day raise a happy family that will be strong and far away from the toxic filth that I was born into then I want to write an autobiography and just before publishing send them each a copy so they will know what they did.Whether or not they regret what they did I hope they become as ugly on the outside as they are within.
