Ive been working with an overly pushy recruiter. I'm looking for a new job because my job involuntarily switched me to second shift and I am looking for something with better hours that will allow me to spend time with my family. Since the first day the recruiter has been pushing me to apply for a better paying job that is a 12 hour rotating shift. Ive said no because I dont think that would work long term and I dont want multiple short term jobs on my resume in a row. He was in the process of setting up an interview at a company I would love to work at but they went on a hiring freeze when my state went under shelter in place.  Last week he asked me (called me 8 times in a row while I was sleeping! He knows I work second but starts calling at 8 am multiple days a week!) If I would consider a phone screen with them since theres not as many jobs out there now. I said I wasnt that interested but i guess id consider a phone screen. I got an email from the company with an online interview time set up. Apparently he told them any day was fine, but I didnt know it was going to be online and I share a computer with my boyfriend and he has online classes that day so I said it would have to be a different day. Its took a while for the company to reschedule (and he called me at inconvenient times every single day while waiting to hear back. During that time I told him im really not very interested in that job, and he basically asked me to do it to be polite.) They emailed me a new time and in interview schedule. Thats when I realized it was a two hour interview. I called the recruter back and said that what I initially thought was a phone screen is now a 2 hour interview and I can not justify spending that much time on a job I know I wont take. He seemed pretty irritated. Did I just kill my chances at that other job when their hiring freeze is over?
