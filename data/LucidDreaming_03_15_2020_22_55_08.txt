My mind is still foggy because i just woke up so sorry for the grammar mistakes that i **will** make lmao, I was watching youtube and fell asleep but in my dream I thought I was still awake scrolling youtube (at least for the first couple of seconds) one of my favorite YouTubers posted and I was excited because she hasn't posted in like a year so I clicked it, it was like a cajun (?) seafood mukbang which was strange because normally she doesn't post that kind of stuff and I don't even know what Cajun seafood meant, come to think of it her face was blurry and I didn't even look at it closely so there was no indication that it was her but my dream decided it was her. When I clicked on the video is when I realized I was dreaming because it wasn't her voice and it wasn't her video editing style and music that sounded like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWLwz9_7o0) type started playing. Thats when I realized I was dreaming and I got excited and started analyzing youtube because I wanted to see how my subconscious thinks youtube looks like and it looked almost like an AI tried to generate youtube from various different pictures, it was accurate yet very off in a way and for some reason the search bar was 'ssssssssssssssssnapchat' and there was pictures of blurry dark dead bodies as the thumbnails for my youtube recommendations (I'm assuming because I'm really into watching forensic files type of stuff on youtube but in reality they never post graphic pictures like that on youtube especially for the thumbnails so it was strange) I was curious about what the comments said and for a brief moment I thought about the possibility of there being a whole community of people who browse the internet during their dreams and can communicate with each other within social media in their dreams ?? It sounds crazy to me now but i decided to try and check the comments either way. I tried to scroll to the comments to see if my conspiracy was true but it wouldn't let me scroll down no matter how hard I tried and It would just glitch like my mouse was broken or something. Eventually, I gave up but i still wanted to go on google or twitter but I woke up:( either way it was so cool because I've never had so much control in a dream before?? normally I **know** I'm dreaming and when I  have a nightmare I can wake myself up when shit hits the fan, but other than that I can't ever control the sequence of events
