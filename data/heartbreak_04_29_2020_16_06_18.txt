we met nearly a year ago and became incredibly great friends turned more than friends but never a relationship. we didn’t actually spend that much time together before he flew home, but we talked everyday, eventually facetimed everyday. i should have seen the signs when he didn’t tell me he had just broken up with his ex. i assumed they had broken up months before we met. turns out it was 2 weeks. but i liked him so much and wanted to be there for him so bad that i let him use me to get over her, i guess. and it caught him off guard because he actually ended up liking me too. we expressed our mutual feelings for each other, 5 months later he flew 6000 miles to visit me for 10 days. after that, he said he loved me. and when i asked what he wanted to do he said nothing. that was 3 months ago. it’s been downhill ever since. he made me feel stupid or silly for assuming he wanted to be with me because he loved me. but he said he didn’t do LDR’s and that he needed to spend more time with me in person before he could commit. i couldn’t fathom having all my feelings for someone be left hanging. i love him too, and wanted to solidify it and be happy with that feeling. this is the first time i’ve ever told someone i love them. and it was awful. i was made to feel like i wasn’t worth it. that he didn’t want to change his ideals or views to make it work with me. and then covid happened and shit came crashing down and he was dealing with depression and all that mixed together caused him to distance himself and me start to reach out more. i’m anxious attachment and he is dismissive avoidant. i was willing to make it work. i accepted his demons and forgave him and loved him and i thought he would do the same for me too. but no. and i feel broken. and stupid. and crazy. and i begged. yep, i begged for him to want this. and he made me feel like it was all my fault. but it was both of our faults, and i forgive him, and i don’t blame him, but i’m so hurt.
