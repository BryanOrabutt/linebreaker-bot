Me and my cousin were really close when we were kids. She’s 3 years older than me. We’d play together all the time. I don’t remember how old I was or how exactly long it went on for (approx 2 years) but she used to teach me about sex. I was definitely under 10 years old, and very very innocent. She used to play games with me such as house, and make me get into bed with her. She didn’t touch any private parts, and I didn’t have breasts yet  but she did touch me under my shirt and move her body right against mine, and tell me to “dance” in bed. She would make me tie my shirt into a bra. I didn’t know any better because I was a kid. I guess one day I realized it was wrong and I told my mom. My mom told her mom and then we stopped talking. To this day we barely even say hi. I know this wasn’t rape or assault, but i know it traumatized me because there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about it and get flashbacks. She messed up my brain and I became aware of sex and sexual things at a young age. Even after we stopped talking, I picked up on the habits she taught me and tied my shirt up and told my school friends about sex, and even made up scenarios with them. (I know it’s disgusting) I didn’t realize it was wrong, or I guess I subconsciously used that as a way to protect myself? Or justify what she did? But after a few years, it started catching up to me, and I realized how wrong it was what she did and how she infiltrated my mind. now I am a very insecure, closed off, shy, and unfulfilled person, and I’ve been struggling for years and years to heal. I’ve turned to repression, and it’s not working. I tend to self sabotage. I am afraid to show anyone how weak I truly am. Any words of advice or anything is helpful, I am deteriorating. Is there a word or term or something to describe what happened to me? I need closure; I need peace.
