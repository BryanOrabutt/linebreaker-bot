In a world of blocks, zombies, and other elements, Minecraft has always held a special place in my heart. I began playing a few years back on my old kindle fire. Although I was fairly new to the game, I immediately became attached to it. The simplistic graphics, nostalgic soundtracks, and fun concept drew me in like a fish on a hook. I still continue to play (mainly with my brother who we’ll call Peter) and I even bought a realm not too long ago. However, something extremely disturbing has been brought to my attention. My brother (an 8 year old boy with a severe speech disorder/special needs) began to act quite strangely as of late. While we were playing in my realm one ordinary afternoon, he began to talk about a secret world he had. The more he continued to ramble, the more my curiosity grew. But what struck me as odd was the fact that he mentioned something about a ‘god’ he spawned in his world through a command block. According to him, he had joined his fairly new creative world when he spotted a random command block lying nearby. He didn’t place it there. Since he was curious, I assume he didn’t think much of it and began to type random nonsense into the block. The moment he clicked out of it, something very hard to describe spawned and someone had joined his world. Keep in mind that this person was not only a total stranger, but he wasn’t on his friend’s list. Even his Minecraft skin was a bit disturbing. The thing that stands out the most were his red eyes. Now, I know what you may be thinking. “How is this that scary? It’s just a random guy who joined the world.” Unfortunately, he didn’t stop there. He began to speak to my brother through his microphone, and he could also hear everything he was saying. My brother started off by complimenting his base, unaware that he could hear him. He then responded to him with something along the lines of “thanks, 𝙋𝙚𝙩𝙚𝙧.” His real name used. My brother never mentioned it to him once. Even his account has no clues of his real name or his bio. Still, my naive brother continued to talk to him, thinking he must’ve made a new friend of some sort. The strange man (who claimed to be 9 years old) then told him that they were going to have some ‘weird, creepy fun and some normal fun’. Apparently, they began to ‘prank’ other users with 𝙧𝙚𝙙 𝙚𝙮𝙚𝙙 𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙢𝙖𝙣 who began to literally 𝙥𝙪𝙣𝙘𝙝 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙠𝙞𝙘𝙠 them while teleporting and even made an ear piercing shriek before exploding. The worst part? My brother said it was actually fun. Maybe it’s just me, but something about this ‘prank’ strikes me as disturbing. Another thing that stood out was this dude’s obsession with red eyed things. It must’ve been a mod he installed, but all of the enderman and zombies had red eyes. The spider’s eyes were white. I was honestly a bit skeptical because I’ve never seen any mods with red eyed enderman, but when I looked up his gamer tag and saw an enderman as his profile pic, I became extremely suspicious. A guy who seems to have a thing for enderman and red eyes has an enderman as his profile pic? And while snooping on his profile, I saw that he had also recently played Minecraft on a kindle fire. The same device my brother used. I think the main reason why I’m so suspicious of this is because he told my brother on a separate occasion that after they were done having ‘fun’ in his world, he could go on (app on my brother’s kindle). The fact that he knew peter had this app on his kindle makes me highly concerned. How is he able to track this? How did he manage to hack my brother’s mic? And let’s not forget his voice. My brother described it as ‘light with a dark undertone). Considering he probably lied about his age and his name (he claimed Fhiff” was his real name), I wouldn’t be surprised if it was an older male who tried to mask the deepness of his voice with a lighter, higher pitch to match his alleged age. My brother even told me that he tried to leave his world one day but the button to exit wouldn’t work. He continued to spam it to no avail, eventually giving up before the man told him that once they were finished with their ‘fun’ he would allow him to leave. I don’t expect this to blow up overnight. I don’t even expect this to get read to its entirety. But please, for the love of god help me remove this predator from Minecraft. His gamer tag is fhiff. My brother is an extremely naive and innocent soul who genuinely loves to make new friends and this man took advantage of him. If this story somehow does become popular, I’ll post updates on the situation.
