So here’s the deal, I’m talking to this guy but i’m having second thoughts about it. Let’s call him “Mark”. My first dilemma is i used to like one of my close friends before talking to Mark but never told my friend about it. Like a month later i went to a dance with my friends and Mark came with us. It was my first time hanging out with him and I didn’t really notice him or talk to him before going to the dance. I kinda was looking and talking to him at the dance though, and thought he was cute. The next day he snapped me and we started talking. I hung out with him and a few others a week later at the movies. At that time I wasn’t talking to my close friend that I used to like as much. After the movies, my close friend sent me this huge text about how he really likes me and would quit drugs for me. I rejected him though because I was talking to “Mark” and knew that wouldn’t be fair to either of them. I feel really bad though. And now I feel like I chose the wrong guy. I’m not really close to Mark and we barely even talk, like it’s the weird stage where you don’t really talk to each other. Except I don’t really think I like Mark. And I don’t think it’s good that I’m talking to him when he likes me(all of my friends told me) and I don’t really know if I like him back. To make matters worse, Mark told me he liked me, and I said I liked him back. At the time I thought that was fine because I thought I sorta liked him and it would just increase anyways. But that’s different now, I haven’t seen him in a while and I don’t know if I like him anymore. We text but that’s not the same, and I like to be friends before dating because then it’s just easier to be myself around them. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to hurt him though because he’s really nice and all of my friends are close to him. Please give me advice.
