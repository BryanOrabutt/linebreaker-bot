so here’s how the story is my mum is sometimes nice but other times is a right asshole and makes me feel depressed, suicidal and just sad over all. She makes me carry drugs, drink, heavy bags and such and such she is horrible most of the time like accuses me of lying, lugging In to her conversations and every time I’d go near her room door she’d scream at me and accuses me of the above she is constantly angry at me and puts me and my 7 yr old brother all the time she makes deals makes us lie to the police and social work by saying she never drinks in front of us which is an obvious lie. We always get threats of people kicking in our door and I’m to afraid to call the police or social work and have thought about running away but I never think I should but I want to. She makes me go and collect people’s money for her like debts and money that there dew her I feel like she doesn’t care for me and I’m constantly the one doing everything like taking my brother to school, cooking dinner, breakfast, and sometimes picking my brother up from school she leaves us alone while she goes to see her new boyfriend most times of the week she is a horrible and selfish person and never lets us see our other family for her own selfish reasons like the fact that she hates them and every time we see them she yells at us for not telling her who was there and she even stopped me from seeing my real grandad who is the dad of my passed away dad and I only knew my grandad for like 2 months not even that because he took us to his birthday party to meet more of my dads side of the family whom I never knew aside from my aunt. I think she is a horrible person and shouldn’t be aloud to be a parent if she is constantly putting us in danger and making us lie to police and sw or cps all the time it’s bad enough that she makes me carry drugs for her and all that I no longer want to live with her but I Have no one to stay with and am to scared to tell the authorities thank you for listening
