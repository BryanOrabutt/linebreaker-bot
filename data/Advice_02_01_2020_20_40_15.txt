Look I’m 15 and I love video games.and no I’m not addicted I can go days without Even touching my Nintendo switch or ps4 but whenever I’m on it my parents say that I play the game to much and they never see me do homework.heres the thing I have a school laptop which I do homework on.so I do my homework in school because that’s where I use my laptop the most. anyways they just don’t understand I don’t even like school but I go and I do the work the best I can but they get disappointed because I get c’s they don’t understand stand how hard school is nowadays 
I have teachers who give out assignments everyday without even teaching us I have a fucking terrible geometry teacher I swear he doesn’t know what he’s doing and he gives us a damn quiz every Tuesday that’s making my grade suffer everyday.i try to do my best I don’t get a b honor roll they think it’s because of the games they think I have to much freedom. I have 4 other siblings and they call me the most I wash the laundry every weekend but when I wanna play they turn into fucking police it’s like I go to school 5 days out of 7 in the week for 8 
hours learning shit that’s not gonna matter after I graduate.my dad Literally got upset because I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I grow up it’s like my guy I’m 15 I’m a damn sophomore 
In a shitty school that doesn’t have any fun electives besides piano.and I my sister really really pissed me off she said and I quote “playing video games make you dumb”that right their makes me so angers she thinks just cause she’s in collage and got good grades in high school that’s she better than everyone she acts fun and friendly then when you say one wrong thing she gets mad but she can say whatever you want to me and I don’t take it to heart but what ever I say she wants to have an attitude for a week or two then when she wants something it’s hey Elijah your my favorite brother she’s a toxic bitch well I think I’m done here
