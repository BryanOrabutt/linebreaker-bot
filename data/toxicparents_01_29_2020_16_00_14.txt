This is going to be a long story. My mother basically gave birth to me and left me with her mother (my mommom) who had raised me my whole life. My "mother" had been in and out of my life, all my life. Constantly in and out of jail. There was a 2 year span I moved in with her when she got married to her abusive alcoholic husband, then they divorced because she couldn't handle the abuse anymore and he threatened to kill my sister, who was another man's baby.. and was supposed to be his (she cheated) so I lived with her for a short time after that, and she then had my brother. She could not stop drinking, constantly drunk. I was 10 years old taking care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old. Eventually I went to my guidence counsellor at school and they contacted cys, we got taken away and placed with my grandmother for good. Fast forward to now. I'm a mom, with 2 kids. Because I have kids she's tried to force herself back into my life and to me she's nothing. She gave birth to me and that is it. People think I'm cold and heartless because I want nothing to do with my mother. No one understands how she used to beat me as a kid when she was drunk, and I never had a childhood because of her. I had to grow up quick, at a very young age. Today I find out she tried to kill herself, she has seizures and she takes meds for them. Today she took all her meds cause she's going to be going back to jail. She's a clepto. Has been caught multiple times stealing over hundreds of dollars worth of alcohol and other items. She tried to kill herself because she did not want to go to jail again, and to be honest, I feel nothing. I don't pity her, I don't feel sad. Am I heartless like people claim ? There's a lot more to this story I won't add, but she has literally made my life fucking hell and when I finally escaped I realize I don't care about her at all. Is that wrong of me ?
