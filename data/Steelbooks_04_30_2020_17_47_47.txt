So firstly let me say I get that right things are going on and stuff is happening bigger then my little baby problems with best buy. But I need to vent on this. Now I have ordered probably 15 steel books from best buy in the last two weeks, they have had some amazing deals and what not. Now the issues. 5 of the 6 Disney Steels I ordered had some form of major damage. Had to get all 5 replaced, 4 of the 5 I lucked out on and the second copies were exceptable. But still had dents/ scratches etc. just in places they wouldn't be noticable if displayedl. And since they were replaced once nothing best buy could do so I let it slide. Now I have gotten a replacement for my copy of Mary Pop Returns. Clearly damage on the front not under the jcard so the person who packaged it to be shipped was aware that this damaged copy was going out damaged to a costumer.... hmmmmm..... Guess what since it's sold out and a replacement copy best buy online won't do a thing for me except take it back and refund it. Fine I will Frankenstein the okay parts and make it work. But be forced to full price... fine. Now I received 3 more steel books today star trek into darkness, transformers 1 and transformers 3. Firstly the TF3 is the metal pack, not what I paid for and is clearly different then what is online, oh and it's damaged... TF damaged on the front and spine.... and the copy of star trek came in a gift set. I though wow cool, but the boxing is crushed. Was clearly packaged that way and big old scratches on the steel book. Like seriously i hate the fact that I have to jump through hoops when all it would take is for someone who is packaging the product to go and say hey would I buy this damaged product at the store. Probably not. Maybe we should try again... It's just piss poor customer service and as someone who works in a place where it's drop everything to make the costumer happy I don't understand how this company can even survive.
