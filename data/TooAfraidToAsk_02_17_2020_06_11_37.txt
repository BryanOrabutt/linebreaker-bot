So me and my sister went to Ralph’s and as soon as we enter we go to the bakery section and there is this guy there across from us and as soon as my sister gets to the bread the guy instantly looks up and keeps staring at her and my sister usually doesn’t look at people who male eye contact with her but she looks up and the stare lingers then we left but my first instinct was did he know her from dating apps and her first instinct was I hope he doesn’t think I like him or something and then he went back to his cart and looked back at me and then I looked up and he looked away really fast and so did I then we left the bakery section went and got the other stuff we came here for and we were at self checkout and this older guy was in the middle and me and my sister went around him because there was room to go around him and he looked at us all confused and started looking at my phone so I thought he might try to steal it or ??? Idk so I put my phone in my pocket and walked out then we saw this green van as soon as we walked out and it was going pretty fast not too fast tho but it was pretty far away so we walked across and I looked and it wasn’t stopping but me and my sister literally saw no one driving the car so I processed that it wasn’t gonna stop and I stopped in the middle and got scared and my sister just kept walking then I looked back and it was finally stopping and I just saw a brown lady with big black dark sunglasses and then finally I left to my car and we got inside and home safely but the first guy at the bakery section reallyyyyy creeped us out like I brought it up and she said it creeped her out too because we described him differently and he stared at us like he knew something about us or as if he knew us but he didn’t then the guy that looked at us as we were walking out creeped us out a little bit because he looked at us like we weren’t supposed to be there then the green van it felt like time wasn’t real and it wasn’t reality we were completely sober!!! And the only time it felt real and safe was when we were getting close to our car and I complained that the bag was too heavy and jokingly angrily said “here!” To my sister and handed her the bag and this guy who was like a dad giggled at us because I was being a brat in a joking way and my sister smiled and then that’s when I finally felt real and okay I felt like okay I’m safe and back into reality! Me and my sister are currently freaking out about this like we don’t know how to explain it but the feeling we had after this whole thing was not normal if this anxiety? What’s ur opinion on this? Any third party that can explain this??
