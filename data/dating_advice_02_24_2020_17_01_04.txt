I was seeing this girl for a few weeks. We got along great. Had good chemistry and after we slept together she kinda started backing off. At first I kept asking her to hang out but I wouldn’t set definite plans so nothing happened. We haven’t spent time together outside of meeting up on our college campus since then and it has been about 3 weeks. I completely stopped texting her first and after 2 days of radio silence she always comes back with a simple “hi”. The first two time she came back I immediately turned the conversation into an opportunity to make plans. I set a time and a place to meet up and she agreed enthusiastically. The first time she said something important came up and she tried to reschedule but I was busy the next day and it didn’t work out. The second time she said she was consoling her friend because her friend’s ex had just gotten engaged and was having a hard time. These plans also included me borrowing an iron to press my shirt for a job interview. She cancelled 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet. I didn’t get upset at her. I expressed my disappointment and told her to let me know if she wanted to make plans another time. She offered to bring me the iron first thing in the morning, which she did. I still have the iron and she initiated another conversation while she was drunk on Saturday. It seemed like she had nothing to say but brought up the idea of her getting her iron back from me on Sunday. She texted again the next morning and I didn’t bring up making plans for her to get her Iron but I ended up playing along with another pointless conversation which ended in her leaving me on read. I want to tell her that “I’m not looking to text for the sake of texting and not to text me unless she’s trying to make plans with me because I value my time and lately you haven’t shown any respect to it” Should I say something like that next time she texts me out of nowhere or should I just start ignoring her until she tries to make a plan?
