A fellow redditor made a post on how toxic you are in this sub and he was right another person a asshole put up a photo where someone threw thier gloves on the public street and he was annoyed and siad it was disgusting to do and whoever did it was a KNACKER theres my problem im a traveller i was disgusted to see someone would throw thier gloves there like that but he shouldnt have used the word KNACKER i made a post here before on how not all of us travellers are bad and people shouldnt be so quick to paint us all with the same brush i got more then half of negitive responces to it people saying ye well do something with my group first when WE behave we will be treated right    WE is not me i act right and a lot more too but theres a lot more bad in our group then good i admit it im ashamed of that i wish the bad crowd would act right but they dont i cant help that so why should i be punished for thier behaviour its not my fault now people siad 2 me KNACKER isnt a slur word its not exclusive to travellers anymore it used to be thats silly yes people might use that word for anyone but i guarantee you when a traveller gets into a argument with a settled person the first insult is either knacker/pikey so stfu telling me its not exclusive slur to travellers when you know very well it is i met some lovely people on here great people honestly the way some people backed me up on my post about travellers and rascim on here the people who backed me up siad comments that i know they trully meant cause i would have a similar response they siad we cant paint travellers all with the same brush etc now they always had empathy and tons of it they knew it wasnt fair that me or people from my group that were the decent people in the group had to deal with nasty slurs from assholes who hide before thier keyboards (keyboard warriors).       To the people on here that listen to me and showed me great respect i respect you and i commend you honestly your gems to the people who were nasty little shits even though i showed u respect and replied calmly you camed back at me 10 times worst you took my kindness for weakness i didnt want to have a discussion and argue with everyone that didnt agree whuch you should have agreed 100 percent causes its rascim to uses slur and you know it i would like to say your absolute arseholes ye think the irish would be the least rascim since we were walked all over by the english for 100 of years and we only have our country back for roughly a 100 years and you lot seem to forget what our greatgrand parents and thier parents etc had to go through your arseholes to the people who showed me some kindness on here who backed me up trying eliminate rascim ty your amazing people      now im leaving this subreddit cause the mods dont seem to care about knacker word on here since i see it atleast once a week on here its wrong you know it is   goodbye mods have some decency and leave my post up i want people to know how they made me feel here this will hopefully make them cop on or they could be spiteful cunts n get a good laugh from it either way i will always continue to fight rascim for travellers blacks Muslims etc were all human beings people forget that it seems.
