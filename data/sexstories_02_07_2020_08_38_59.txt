Few years ago, while I was married. My ex-wife’s best friend, who at the time was our in home babysitter. Had gotten very fond of me. Usually we would have about an hour alone together before my wife got home. Usually we would just talk. But for some reason one day we were both just in a mood. I went upstairs to get a shower and impulsively I asked her if she would give me a hand. She just looked at me, her eyes got all wide, and she shook her head yes. She followed me upstairs to the shower, and I get a call from my wife saying she will be home early. Her friend ran downstairs and I locked the door behind me. Close call!!. Her friend then texted me a bunch of nudes on Snapchat and told me to finish myself off. Obviously I did. The next day, I took a long lunch break and came home. We sat on opposite sides of the couch and made awkward small talk. Then I looked over at her and said “ are we gonna keep talking or are you going to let me fuck you “ she nodded and came over to my side of the couch. Fucked in my wife’s spot on the couch. The sex was so good that I had to keep coming back for more. We did this for about 2 months, everyday before my wife got home. Eventually I started resenting my bitch ex wife and made myself even more of an asshole. I would fuck her best friend, and then an hour later make my wife suck my dick with her friends juice still all over my cock. That was oddly gratifying. I loved the danger, the Terrible nature of what I was doing. It turned me on more than any sex I’ve ever had in my life. Could it be that the trill of sex is what makes it so amazing. Not the actual act itself? I’ve thought about this a lot over the years. I’ve always wanted to cheat again to confirm. But honestly, not sure if I wanna go down that road again. Anybody else enjoy the same thing?? Let me know in the comments.
