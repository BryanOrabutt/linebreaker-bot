I needed a job 3 years ago, so I started looking everywere for a job, in restaurants, the internet, offices, etc. i was desperate for a job and when i was looking for a job in the internet, I saw an ad for a job, it was a job looking for someone to deliver packages, i clicked on the ad because i knew how to drive really good and i knew all the locations of my towns and when i clicked on the ad the only thing i saw is the logo of the package delivery company and some questions, the questions were normal, they asked if i knew how to drive, my age, my direction, etc. so when i filled in the questions, i just redirected me to a page that said: "you were approved!, just come to this direction at 9:00pm, your salary will be $50,000 a year" it was a little weird at first because it was almost immediately and the salary was a lot for only delivering packages but i ignored the weird things and i felt really happy becuase i finally had a job. i went to that direction, i arrived a little bit late because the bus didnt arrived to the bus stop so i had to grab a taxi, but when i arrived there was only a truck with the logo of the company, the keys of the truck were in the trunk of the truck, i just grabbed them but it was really weird because, in what job does someone leaves a truck alone with the keys, i entered the truck and i saw a page with the place i needed to go deliver the package, but also there was a set of instructions that pointed out in red letters that it was important to follow them, so i read theam and this is what the instructions said: "Congratulations!! you were accepted in our company, follow these intructions they are very important. you need to start driving at exactly 9:30, it is very important for you to go at exactly 9:30pm, while you are driving you will hear thet wind is getting stronger, dont worry, at 10:00pm you will start to see that your windows starts to roll down, dont roll them up, this will make the trip harder, 3 minutes later you will start hearing some voices, when you hear them, you need to turn up your radio and act like nothing is happening, dont worry, when the voices stop, you will see a woman standing in the middle of the street, when you see her dont panic, just turn of the headlights and keep going, at this point you woint be able to get out of the truck no matter what but dont worry, 5 minutes later your truck will stop moving, and then you will hear something hitting the back of the truck, when you hear that, hit the left left window twice and then hit the right window once, this will make the noises stop, but if the noises get louder, you wont be able to do anything, but dont worry, if the noises stop you can continue your trip, halfway your trip you will see a dog walking down the street, when you see him look at the sky till you hear that you hit something, dont worry, 7 mintues later your tires will start deflating, dont worry, when this happens, just turn off your car completely and do not go out of the truck
