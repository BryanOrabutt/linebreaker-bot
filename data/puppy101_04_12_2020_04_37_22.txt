Hey guys, I think I might have accidentally ruined a whole week’s worth of crate training. So my puppy will be 8 weeks old tomorrow, and also I will have had her a whole week. She has been sleeping with us at night this past week while she transitioned to her new home. This was probably my first mistake, but even so she has been eating meals and drinking water exclusively in her crate all week during the day, with the door open the first 4 days and the door closed this past 3, with no issues. I’ve also been moving her to her crate after she falls asleep on the couch, and she is ok with this. Well, this afternoon I was laying down with her on the bed and she couldn’t fall asleep to save her life. It was 30 minutes of her adjusting and just being generally miserable. I took her out to make sure she just didn’t need to go out, but no dice, she started to be just as restless on the couch when we came back in. She was SO sleepy and she doesn’t like all the light that pours into my living room, as well as my loud appliances (I think I had the washer machine going), so I moved her to her quiet, dark crate and closed the door our of desperation. She wined for about 10 mins, but then slept LIKE A BABY. My bf took her out a couple hours later, and I guess I didn’t explain to him thoroughly enough (he’s not as experienced with training dogs) that you never force her into the crate, but apparently he did when they got back in, and again she wined for about 10 mins then fell asleep. It’s been a couple hours again now and I just got back in from taking her out, and now she won’t even go near the crate. She won’t go near it to drink water or for treats. I won’t let her into the bedroom, but we are currently on the couch. I’m unsure what to do now because I cannot lure her back into the crate and I don’t want to force her, but I know I shouldn’t let her back in the bed with us. Any suggestions on what I should do????? I feel so terrible and stupid right now.
