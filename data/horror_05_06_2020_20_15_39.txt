I’ve been working from home for about 2 months now and slowly making my way through my watch list. For a long time I was just adding films and the list grew larger and larger. It’s strangely satisfying to check them off after making no progress for so long.             &nbsp;                                                                              Blood Quantum- watched this last night on Shutter. I’ve been waiting to watch this for a long time but tried to go into it with no expectations (loved the idea of a majority native cast). It’s a memorable and creative take on the zombie movie. Like I said went in with no expectations and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend.                                                             &nbsp;                                                                                     Disturbing Behavior (1998)- Watched based on a recommendation from this sub. Loved it. It was full of 90’s cheese. It reminded me a lot of The Faculty, a personal favorite.                                                    &nbsp;                                                                                    Ghost Stories (2017) - I’d heard good things about this one but honestly it didn’t do much for me. I felt disappointed by the story.                                                    &nbsp;                                                                                     Suspiria (2018)- Wow. A feast for the eyes. Highly recommend. I’m mad I waited so long to watch it. Full disclosure I have not watched the original.                        &nbsp;                                                                                    Coherence (2013)- Trippy and fun. Overall very enjoyable. I do feel like it was a bit overhyped from what I read on this sub but I also couldn’t get past looking at one of the main characters and seeing Xander from Buffy lol.                                                            &nbsp;                                                                                     The taking of Deborah Logan - Imo it was ok at best. Man, this kind of movie used to be my bread and butter but I think my preferences have changed. Wasn’t quite scary enough for me and though I like the documentary/Alzheimer’s angle of it I don’t feel like it was executed very well.                                                &nbsp;                                                                                    Beast (Shutter)- highly recommend. The kind of film that stayed with me for a few days and left me thinking about it long after I finished it. I don’t want to spoil too much so I’ll just say it’s a slow burn, psychological horror with no gore if I remember correctly? and the sexual energy is palpable.                          &nbsp;                                                                             The nightingale (Hulu)- also highly recommend. Though not exclusively horror. It’s a beautiful and horrifying film. The quality is top notch but there’s some brutal scenes of violence and a rape, though personally I do feel it adds to the story and is not gratuitous.                                                                     nbsp;                                                                                    I’ve also watched some god awful stuff, the worst probably being Summer of 84’ and Housewife both on shutter.                                                                      &nbsp;                                                                   Anyways, I’d love to hear what everyone else is watching at home during quarantine? What’s the last movie you watched in theaters before this all started? For me it was the invisible man so I feel like I went out with a bang but boy do I miss going to my local theater.
