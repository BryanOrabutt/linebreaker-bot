My boyfriend is talking to other females on his Snapchat account. He lied saying it was hacked but he still has it to talk to other females. I have proof and he keeps on lying saying it’s not him. He tried to flip the switch on me and say that I’m a hoe. I asked him why , his response was “I been asking around and that’s what people was telling me” it was so random , like out of no where when he said that. He’s trying to cover his tracks up. Why do men still lie after they have got caught. When I tried to talk to him about it he laughed at me and called me delusional. I’m a emotional person , I’m putting my all into this guy. I am no where near a hoe. I have so much respect for him man it’s crazy. While I was talking to him he said I’m going to sleep” and now he’s sleep. I have this sick feeling in my stomach that’s been lingering for weeks now. It hurts me so much we’re currently otp right now and he’s sleep. I had a talk with him explaining that he needs to send me the password because I know that he’s lying. And that he shouldn’t hide anything from me at all. And he’s just STILL LYING. His excuse is “oh so u don’t want to be with me, is that what it is” that LITTERALLY is the opposite and he knows that, what do I do 😩😩😩he laughed and said “we will talk about this in the morning” then laughed and said “girl U won’t leave me” I just want him to be honest with me , he keeps saying he wants to be with me but why is he doing these things? Now that he’s sleep his Snapchat is inactive. (I made a fake account as another girl and he was flirting with me) while he was up , he was actively answering. Now that he’s sleep. It’s no answer (that’s another way I know he is lying) I still have all the proof but Idk what to do honestly. Why can’t he be honest with me? Why can’t he tell me the truth? Why say u love me and want to be with me and do this, even after ...... keep in mind as I’m typing this we’re still otp , he’s sleep, I’m in a emotional mess, he said we can talk about it in the morning 😔
