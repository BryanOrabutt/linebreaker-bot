Okay to do some background for everyone I'm 12 but this happened when I was 11 so now to the story. So my neighbors live in a million dollar house what they are the most annoying Rich neighbors I've ever but they're entitled so you're going through Stars I was over at their house cuz their ed was around 8 or 9 at the time I don't remember so I decided said I was going to go back down to my house now they live on a giant Hill because they need like a lot of room for their house so I decided to head down the hill to go back down to my house so the next day the ek wanted me to go to ek house and I said no I am busy and which at the time I was playing game online with some of my friends she's. Annoyed and she wanted to go get Ed he said why won't you play with my ek and I said right now I'm busy with friends because I don't get to see them very often cuz we live different parts of the country and he goes all they're not important right now and I say bull s*** then here's when the ed goes full entitled. Get off get off your computer right now go play with my daughter and I say get the f*** out of my house and don't come back so then the ed left with his ek but this is not where it ends so the next day I was driving around my four wheeler around my perimeter but then my mom said I can go down to get the mail so I did but the ed stopped me and said what are you doing and I said getting my mail then the ed said give me that four wheeler and I tell him are you f****** nuts this four wheeler is mine not yours and then the ed tried jumping out of his car to grab my four wheeler so I drove off but the ed got back in his truck and started following me so I put it up on other gear and I just started to go really fast and then I took a sharp turn and then I lost him so I decided to head back down to my house and from that day since I haven't seen them I hope you enjoyed the story and I hope I get put in one of redditors YouTube videos thanks for reading.
