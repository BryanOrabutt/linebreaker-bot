Hi i have to say that i’m already sorry for gramatical errors i don’t speak english quite well. I’m a female intp and i’ve never dated anyone. I must add and that’s the pure truth that i’ve had options and i’ve had chances but i somehow never felt this subject (kissing multiple people and finding love) very appealing. i saw a lot of shit coming from my parents relationship i’ve never had faith in a healthy relationship (in convenient ways). what i mean by this is that i WANT love but i would never seek it or try to find one in conventional ways i’m simply ok w it. but a year ago i’ve met my best friend (INTJ male) and we had so many great times studying together we think similar and we have a very matching humor type, so far so good. in the end of last year he came to me and said he had feelings for me and well i didn’t know at the time but now im quite sure i already had feelings for him as well but all i said at the moment was like “ok im not angry with you” (i had told him before i usually go angry over this type of shit, specially when another friend of ours(istp) said he wanted to date me). well we’re now separated bcuz gay quarantine and he is studying in another state (i hope to get in the same college next year but i need the grades (hes kinda helping me with time scheduling how cool huh))and i feel like talking to him trough text it’s incredibly great but not as great as in person. i feel like he holds himself less when we’re together in person, same for me, we go kinda gay. but a few time ago he told me to forget about the feelings stuff that happend last year that he was no longer feeling like that. AND NOW WHAT!????!so my question is. did he said that as a coping mechanism to not look stupid because he thinks i dont care about his feelings or is he actually over it i mean shit i havent told him i like him but i gave my subtle signs in my own intp way he should know im problematic right??? now i feel stupid for he is over it and im certainly not
