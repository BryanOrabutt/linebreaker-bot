I've only known that I'm pregnant for 3 days now and this is already once of the worst experiences of my life.  I always thought "oh if I ever get pregnant I'll just have an abortion!" I never thought it would be this stressful, uncomfortable, traumatic... I think Ive been crying for 3 days straight. I can't control myself, I just want it to be over but now I have to be pregnant for at least another two weeks...  they decided to book my ultrasound for today, so I went, then AFTER laying on a hospital bed staring at the ceiling with tears in my eyes for what felt like eternity.. The nurse says to me "oh, your last period was January 24? You're only 4 weeks then it's too soon for an ultrasound. Oh well youll have to come back and do it again then!" I just lost it and started bawling, I already missed two days of work for no reason now I have two more appointments before we can even make an appointment for the actual procedure, it feels like it's never going to end... Why the fuck did they book my ultrasound KNOWING how far along I was (they had asked 4 or 5 times for different paperwork ) if it was too early ???? Why make me go through more than I have to ???  I have support from my best friend + boyfriend but neither of them have gone through this and  I've never felt more alone in my entire life, and I had to go alone to this appointment. Every nurse so far ive dealt with has said "oh so you're still thinking about your options right?"  I've never been more clear or sure that I need an abortion and I feel like I'm being dicked around by everyone. One nurse called it "the baby" and I almost puked. I've been feeling sick and awful and disgusting for days i don't know how I'm going to make it two more weeks like this, at least.... feels like a nightmare that's never going to end. Not sure what I'm looking for here, mostly just to vent and be heard by people who might understand. Thanks for reading ❤️
