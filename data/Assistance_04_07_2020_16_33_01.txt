Hello! I hate asking for help, but hopefully I came to the right place. I rescued my dog less than a year ago from a pit bull rescue. His name is Jackson and he's all white except one brown spot on his ear. His ears are cropped, but whoever did them cut them a little crooked. He's got a big block head and the biggest smile I've ever seen on a dog. He's energetic, fun, and he loves my mini me. He loves hiking and chasing balls and swimming. I got him last June, after I had to put my three year old pitty down because of cancer. I was heartbroken and wanted to rescue a dog to help me through the heartache. I knew a rescue would be the perfect distraction, and I wanted to save a life, especially a rescue in memory of my first dog. Jackson's back story was that he was tied up for most of his young life and someone beat him so bad, they broke the bottom part of his jaw. When I got him from the shelter, they told me about his story and how the jaw was fixed. They also told me he had heartworm. I was naive and had no idea how much the heartworm treatment would cost, but I got him fully treated and he is now heartworm free. A couple weeks ago, the scar under his jaw began to grow a large angry red bump, and I took him to the vet. He needed to have a tooth removed from the trauma area and they told me the metal plate and screws holding his jaw together are loose and need to be removed. The specialist vet quoted me $3500-$4800. I managed to get an extra thousand line of credit for my care credit card, but it's still no where near enough. If I don't get this surgery done, I will have to put him down and I'm not ready to put another dog down so soon. Please if you can help in any way, I would greatly appreciate it. I don't really know where else to turn. He is a member of my family and I'm trying to do whatever I can to keep him alive. Please, he's only two years old.
