I got a job as an ASM about two weeks ago and was pretty excited despite the reviews and such that I read. But from there everything went downhill... The store I was going to didn't have a SM for months because the DM thought it was bright to send her to another store without a replacement. And one of the keys had to step up to ASM (essentially SM). Everything was wrecked. They had rolltainers in the back for days, everyone there had been hired within this year so no one knew anything or had time to do CBL'S. So I was thrown in along with a SM who was brand new which was fine until she started to lose grip on reality. We don't have time enough to do what we're supposed to do for the moment and the truck comes regardless if we're ready or not. These people were already burnt out  (we only have 4) and can do but so much. But nevertheless she started to be more and more rude and all of the things we HAD to get done kept piling and piling up to the point where we had two trucks basically in our store at one time due to no one having time to do them. I realized that shit was never going to get better until they brought in people who knew what they're doing but at this pay rate? Psht good luck. So last Friday I (which I shouldn't have but didn't want to be a dick) I did our Fresh truck for her and put all of the backstock away, then promptly clocked out and handed her my keys and said I quit. I'm sorry but I feel like I deserve to  work for a company who would at least train me before penalizing me and sending me every little mistake via text message for a job I was literally trained two days on. They ruined what I thought would be my first real venture into upper management due to trying to get warm bodies in. I hope that someday this company and the way they treat their workers sometimes will be revealed to the public so you guys can get a better experience. Sorry for the rant, I just had to get this off my chest!
