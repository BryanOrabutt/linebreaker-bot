We have been together nearly 3 years. We are 300 odd miles apart from each other but we video chat regularly and try to visit as often as possible. Our first valentine's he got me a card and present, and I got him a card and present. Last valentine's we did the same except the times he visited my house he hasn't once bothered to pick up his gift and take it home despite me reminding him. He doesn't seem to like the gift so I haven't bothered to send it to him just for it to be tossed in the corner like he does with other things I've gotten him. This year I spent a week hinting that I'd like him to come up and visit as this is the first time valentine's has been on a weekend in our relationship (he can only visit weekends, I can only visit during school holidays due to have a young child from a previous relationship) and he didn't say anything about my hinting and cause he's surprised visited me before I got my hopes up thinking thats what he's up to. Friday came and went and he didn't show up. He didn't even react to my happy valentine's message I'd sent him, then at 11pm I finally get through to him and as a last thought he said oh happy valentine's day. In a can't be bothered way. I had gotten him a card and presents but he didn't get me anything, I'd understand if he was short on money after all he has a teenage son to care for but he recently bought computer parts that would have cost hundreds, so he bought himself unneeded parts instead of spending time with me which I don't understand. He's only been at my house once in the last year and I've been at his 4 times. I can't visit him anymore as due to a weakened immune system I catch every bug when I'm at his (he lives near a city, I live in a rural town) and my health can no longer take it however I do plan on moving closer to him to allow my immune system to strengthen. He barely talks. I don't know what to do. Am I wasting my time? Am I overreacting about valentine's?
