I spend several hours a day in a library and while my Bang Olufsen E4 in ear headphones with active noise cancellation do a good job of blocking out the AC and keyboard noises, I am tired of in ear headphones and active noise cancellation. I realised that over ear headphones with good isolation are just as good or even better than active in ear headphones. I have heard both the bose quietcomforts 2s as well as the Sony wh-1000xm3 and while their noise cancellation is amazing, I didn't like the sound signature that much. Yes the bass was very powerful but the mids and treble were not to my liking. I know you can eq them but even then I am stuck with a headphone that does sound worse in passive mode when I am at home. I am looking for a **portable** (this means foldable, I can't carry a huge box around as well as medical textbooks otherwise my backpack is going to explode), **subtle** (I don't want to look like a weirdo wearing something like the Dan Clark aeon 2 which look nice but wearing something huge, bright red and wasp shaped is gonna draw a lot of attention, something in black, silver, grey, dark blue or subtle wood is prefered), **wired** (no bluetooth), **good isolation** (more concerned about sound leaking in than out as I listen to low volumes and often just play nothing through them just to cancel out noise), **price** (doesn't matter that much as I buy everything used but shouldn't exceed 500â‚¬, however, budget can be stretched), **no massdrop** (I live in europe and while bought the Koss ESP 95X for 290$ from their EU division and I am very happy with them, 20% taxes, shipping costs and another 5% import duty make massdrop too expensive since they cancelled their EU support), **good sound quality** (I don't want to spend that much money and then be let down when I plug them into my stereo at home, something on HD600 mid tier level would be appreciated), **comfortable** (I am gonna wear these headphones for many hours a day so it definetly needs to be more comfortable than my Grado Sr325e), **detachable cables** (would be preffered as i need a short cable on the go and a fairly long cable at home so I can relax on my couch). I am struggling to find headphones that meet all these criteria. The Neumann 20, Oppo Pm 3, Audeze El-8 closed backs seem to be one of the few that could meet these criteria. If you know more, I would appreciate if you could share them and if you own one of the above your impressions could also help me. Thanks in advance!
