I need opinions and answers about certain things. Okay, so I have been playing video games all my life. I mean, I started off with Doom and Half-Life. But since I've never had a good internet connection, I don't have any experience with online video games. Luckily I got a fiber connection one and a half month ago. When I jumped into Apex, one thing was made very clear to me by other players, that online FPS are way different than the offline ones haha. I was thrashed like hell, I still do. Anyway, so I don't really know what a good KDR is and how to measure my progress but I'll tell mine. Week 1, my KDR was at 0.35, week 2 around 0.49, week 3 it was at 0.60, week 4 at 0.73 and today after a little bit over a month I touched 0.80 and that's where I am now and I am pretty sure those are very rookie numbers. Also, my average damage per game is 270 and my level is 60. Have won around 22 matches but I'm pretty sure that even though that's the goal of the game, it's still much much easier than having a higher KDR or good average damage per game. I play at a steady 100-110 ms ping and around 4-8% packet loss, I don't know if it does have any real affect on my game or not. On my load out I usually have a Havoc and an R99 or the other one (R301, I guess?). I have problems with using Peacekeeper and Wingman but I see people rock those guns very well. Where am I doing the mistake? I am trying to figure out the game but I'm not consistent with my performance. On some matches I get 5 kills or 6 or 7 and then on some I'm like getting 1 man down or even none. It gets pretty overwhelming when someone with a golden shield jumps right at me and I'm with the level 1 shield. How do I tackle that? How have I progressed? Where do I stand in terms of numbers? In short I just need good advices and opinions about things, tackling fully equipped squads, about load outs and opinions on my KDR and what a decent KDR should look like. Thank you. Also, I play with Bangalore.
