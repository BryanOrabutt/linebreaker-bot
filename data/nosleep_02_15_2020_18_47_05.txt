A little context about this, it was a rainy night and me and my sis were home alone and our parents consider learning how to use guns might save our lives, damn right they were.. We were sleeping in our bunk bed and heard scratching downstairs but we didnt bother cause we assumed it was our cat (we have a fat and noisy cat) we kept sleeping only until the scratching got louder and louder, and faint sounds of whispering got more intense i asked my sis if it was our little brother and she said that he went out with our parents cause he claimed that he was satans son cause it was what his friends from school said the scratching and the whispering got loud enough that forced to get our asses out of bed i grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight and me and my sis made our way through the upstairs hall, to the stairs and downstairs we turned on the living room lights and we only saw our cat was DEAD we panicked and noticed a trail of his blood from the kitchen to the living room until we heard whispering in the guests’ bathroom we went in front of the door where the whispering came from i whispered to my sis ‘should i open the door’ she replied ‘maybe but go grab something just incase its some crazy homeless guy.’ I went upstairs and got a aluminum survival knife my dad let me use in emergencies we slowly opened the door and me and mt sissied eyes widened in shock, terror, and adrenalin it was not a crazy homeless guy, but it was a tall humanoid creature thing wuth dull refectice eyes and a wet womens wig that looked as if it was made in 1942 we stared at the thing that looked like my first grade teacher for half a second and dashed upstairs to the room where the hidden shotgun was (the part where i used my gun training is gonna come so be prepared) the creature ran behind us and i was faster than a tesla and it immedietly started to bang on the door and we heard its ear piercing screeches and it was scratching the door loudly my sis grabbed the shotgun case and opened it, and loaded it with some of the stronger ammo we had in the house she pointed it at the door and was ready to shoot the tim burton movie-like creature the second it jumped in this is the part when the creature made a hole big enough for me to throw the army knife at it so we could hide and get ready for the shotgun shot i threw the knife and the creature screeched which woke up our neighbors and they dialed 911 we heard police sirens from the distance outside and the creature ripped the door open and my sis shot the creature clean in the head and again in its chest we heard police breaking down the front door and rushing upstairs and the creature fell over with a huge thud and the police ran inside our room and my sister fainted the police were in shoch about what the fucking hell this creature was, the police alerted our parents and they came and took my sis to the hospital and the creature was taken to a quarentine place thing and was tested and now im sitting in the hospital next to my sister who is watching me write this right now and the police are gathering information about what that thing was i will make a second post if you want about some more information bye!
