So Christmas Eve last year, I got a message from a female who wanted me to get her pregnant. I don’t know why I agreed with it to be honest, maybe it was the way she expressed to me that she wanted to be a mother or something else entirely, but I accepted the offer because I’m a dumb, single, 21 year old. Why not make some bad decisions. We limited contact with each other before hand and afterwards, we went about our way and unmatched with each other so there was no way we could contact each other. But before all of this I found her on a social media platform and followed her because I was curious, about the kid she was going to have because even though I wouldn’t have been in the kid’s life, something in me drove me to want to know about the life I helped create. Well today I found out through this platform, that I just randomly checked, that she had a miscarriage and a wave of sadness hit me like a wall. Yes, I wasn’t supposed to be in this kid’s life. Yes, I wasn’t even responsible for the life. But something hit me, a wave of sadness and guilt. Even though it “wasn’t my responsibility” and it never would be, It was still mine in the sense that it was a part of me. And it was life, life that came from me that will never see this world. It’s sad, even though I played a very minuscule part in the whole equation, the life I helped create, the life that was an extension of me is gone and never had a chance. I want to reach out to her, help her, and be there for her even if she is a stranger because she probably feels worse than I do but at the end of it all, I’m conflicted because I don’t feel that I have the right to these emotions because of the fact that I was never destined to be a father for this child in the first place. Am I wrong to feel sad and guilty because I would’ve had nothing to do with the child or is it justified for me to feel loss for someone I helped create that never got a chance to even live?
