 I honestly don't even know why I'm in the trust factor I'm in, although i do admit sometimes i can be a little toxic like telling my team to shut up mid round which annoys them even further but i dont even play that good, I understand everyone gets fishy clip once in a while but my trust facotr is so far in the dirt i had to borrow my friends account just so i could play MM without getting destroyed by a level 0 steam account with 22 hours claiming to be a global smurf while he moonwalks across the sight and jitters from his trash anti-aim, It's literally unplayable every player that isnt cheating is griefing and there is no way out of it, its so easy to get reported 5 times by an entire team cause you got a nice flick which slowly starts your decent into hell as you encounter more cheaters and more griefers that the game isnt even a game anymore, its a chore, I am SMFC (deranked from global) getting 3+ cheaters every game, i have thousands of dollars in skins, screenshots, hours other games, a high level steam account, medals but valve sees my account on the same level as the one with cracked prime and 13 hours in the game getting 70+ frags every game, I understand i can just play ESEA and Faceit which i do but since im a high level on both i can only play them when i have properly wamred up and im ready to try my hardest, i play MM to have some fun with friends and chill out while still taking it seriously but its come to the point where im not even playing the game 80% of the time cause i have to +left and get 16-0 by the newest counter strike prodigy with 50 hours in the game and the incredible ability to use echo location to find people around corners, not to mention his bullets with heating seeking abilities that never miss, then i see people in high trust factor with the gamesense tag moving around going semi rage with AA and a bunch of knives and stuff that never get banned and stay at a high trust factor all the time, I just wish one tilted guy that hasnt had a very good day didnt have the ability to cry about me to the other team when im having a good game to report me which destroys my trust factor to the point of no return causing me to make a new account, and before anyone asks i have no game bans or vac bans on my computer or IP and have no logged into anyones account where they have cheated on or in the past, I have emailed valve and nothing, I hope to return to CS and enjoy the game again but for now im gonna take a break and see if my trust factor gets any better, goodbye cuties :)
