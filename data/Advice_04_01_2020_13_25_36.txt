I fucked up today, I was trying to get on with some school work, and went to print off some sheets emailed by our teacher, I asked my mum and she started yelling at me about ink and stuff, she sounded as though she was being irrational, because she was claiming amazon was shut even though it’s not, I said I’d pay for her replacement ink if it was too draining, she carried on. I went to the printer anyway shortly after (mistake No.1) and went to print off the sheets, she lost it completely, yelling things, ripping paper out of my hands and saying she was going to lock the study, I walked away, saying I needed it still and would need to use the printer at some point, she started following me and getting in my face and yelling, I then go physical, it was a really shitty thing to do, not hit her but push her face away from me, and as I kept walking pushed her pointing hand away from me, I said something along the lines of “don’t do that” and she started laughing and saying or what, I tried to stay cool, and said “you’ll make a fool of yourself” and she then kept prodding for what I really meant, I finally turned around and lifted my arm, not to hit her, the best way I can describe it is all the anger in my body wants to do something, I know I can’t but a physical reaction happens semi-involuntary, I have anger issues, and am aware I’m responsible for my own behaviour. Anyway after this I went upstairs and she kept going, yelling at me from the banisters, I looked back and she got right in my face again, I got that feeling again of wanting just to hurt something, and a part of me wanted to really get out of her face, I went to do something but I had enough restraint to just blow, which is still a shitty thing to do. I feel fucking terrible, especially with virus going round, I work at a supermarket, although it would spread in our house fast if I had it, the action is still pretty direct, although I wasn’t thinking with intention like that. I know this paints me in a bad light, nothing justifies it, this however was beyond my normal anger, I’ve been trying control myself and be tolerant around my family but it just boiled over today, I’d never felt rage like it, I’m not exaggerating when it felt like a new feeling. What do I do, I’ve apologised by I feel action or discipline is needed, because this was considerably too far.
