So I've been going to this a methadone clinic for about 4 years now the first two years was awesome and then they got swallowed up by some big chain company and the place has been utter chaos since. I could go on and on with horror stories in what they do but I'm trying to find a device because the clinical supervisor (who only got her job by the way because the person actually qualified for the job left the turnover rate there is amazing because it's a rat hole I've been there longer than any of the staff and that should tell you). Anyways his supervisor always discriminates against me she makes everything the most difficult and on top of everything because of the other chaos fights break out all the time because they have an incredible wait time for dosing and people just cut in line and the staff doesn't care they don't do their job none of them are qualified for the job and if anybody knows anything about methadone clinics cutting in line is going to start a fight every time. Anyways because of this incidence Haim being teamed up on by five or six people who are the main culprits of this abusive system and it's not that I'm scared of them cuz I know I could easily take all of them by myself not trying to sound tough but there are bunch of snitches to which is ironic cuz they're the ones that start to s*** anyways I'm rambling and I apologize that you had to read all the way to this to get the main point. Basically any lawyers out there that have any advice for me as far as a civil case or to see the clinic because supervisor now knows of the incident and is knowingly letting the bullying and attacks continue against me. I don't feel comfortable going there anymore it's not a safe environment I can't believe the police hasn't even shut down yet by the standards of that clinic any f****** Yahoo could open one. BTW this is fashion valley comprehensive treatment center. So to any lawyer nice enough to read this do I have any kind of case or any way to cease and desist? Ty
