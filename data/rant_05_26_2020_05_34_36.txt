Holy shit the stupidity of people pisses me off. I am not talking about people that are bad at math or have that one really stupid moment, I am talking about people who make stuff up to make their side of the argument/debate/whatever fit what they want to hear. I am so done with people saying the corona virus is a hoax and the government is just trying to get power my grandmas fucking boyfriend believes that and I am so on the verge of calling him out I really am, because it makes me lose brain cells every time he talks saying it's a hoax and it was created the by the government and Bill Gates yeah that's right Bill fucking Gates has the cure and is ready to mass produce it. Flat earthers, anti-vaxers, corona virus hoax people whatever please just send them off on a boat to Antarctica please I can't stand it. The amount of bullshit that comes out of peoples mouths piss me off to oblivion. The next time I am in public and someones says "Oh 5G cAuSeS tHe CoRoNaViRuS" I am going to walk up to them and just rip into them calling them an idiot between every single word. You know what is another thing that pisses me off **POLITICS**, okay I don't care if you are a Republican or Democrat, but if you say all republicans are racist or all democrats are communists and you aren't joking  I honestly hope you get shipped off to the middle of the ocean. Another thing is **RELIGION.** I don't care if you believe in a religion or even if you believe in a god damn flying pig god if you do not accept evolution, I am calling you stupid until the day I die. Also those people that defend a person because of whatever reason even though that person did something illegal and admitted to it I really hope you get locked in prison just like the person who committed the crime. Another fucking thing I hate is having a simple debate with someone, but I am FUCKING TEXTING IT ON MY PHONE WITH A STUPID ASS CHARACTER LIMIT. That is honestly the thing that pisses me off the most, not being able to type fast and a lot without posting five billion different things. Another thing I hate is when you are in an arguement with someone and they legit look something up and only look at the answer google gives them even though it's fucking wrong, but they won't believe it because it supports their side of the argument. Now into some more politic stuff if you support **Donald J. Trump** cool. I really don't care you do you, BUT if you think every thing he tweets is responsible for a president to be tweeting I hate you with a passion as well. I am also sorry that you had to read such a horrible rant from someone who swore in between every word, but my anger is un-explainable.
