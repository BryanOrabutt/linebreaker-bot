(Sorry for the bad punctuation not good at it) So as the title suggests idk if this belongs in this subreddit but like I dont feel okay emotionally, like I havent seen people die or things of that equivalent but i have been hurt and its messed me up pretty bad.  Maybe it just feels this way because I'm going through my "emotional teenage" phase but it's something but back to what I'm here for.  So I'm a 16 year old male in my junior year of high school and these are supposed to be my best years of my childhood but my actions and other peoples actions have made it some of my worst years.  So first off at the age of 15 I ended up getting 2 felonies for some really fucking stupid reasons which caused me to be put on probation and sent to rehab for a year which has been putting a lot of pressure on me and my grades have been falling causing me to fail my classes which is adding on to the struggle of trying to get my future together because I cant just get rid of the felonies I have now and they're gonna follow me for a long time.  Or how I'm constantly being used by people and being hurt and even if I dropped the people who hurt me I constantly find new people who hurt me more then the last, or how because I've been hurt and have the pressure from the felonies I've feel into a drug habit which I'm also in rehab for and all of the groups I have to go to I have no time to just... be a kid and the little bit of free time I have just feels consumed by my depression it causes me to just want to shelter myself away from everyone and when I try to put myself out more to be around people I feel constantly reminded of exactly why I feel depressed whether it's my parents constantly talking about my grades or felonies or people hurting me I always end right back in my room sheltering myself or when I try to talk to people about how I feel to try to make myself feel better they always try to add hidden meanings to what I'm saying and never listen and it's so frustrating I feel like I have no one I can talk to and the person who has hurt me the most is the only person I feel like I can be happy around she hurts me in almost everything she does and it's so toxic because I love her regardless no matter how many times shes hurt me or what shes dont to hurt me I only love her more and more as time progresses and i hate myself for how much i love her, maybe it's not real love but I feel like if it isnt it's the closest you can be to loving someone but not love them i dont find joy in anything anymore unless I'm around her and i dont care about anything not even my own family besides her and it's so fucking ironic because i forced myself to bot care about anything just so i wouldnt be hurt by her but now the only thing I care about... is her and it sucks it sucks so much I even forced myself to hate her but it only made me love her more and I'm doing everything I can to remove myself from her but my parents wont let me change anything I just want to live a happy successful life which I dont think is asking too much but every action I make I feel is just leading further and further down the opposite path even when I try to get off this path I feel as I'm being pulled further down it and its eating away at me and I just feel so broken and I doubt anyone is reading this but if you read this far... I hope you're doing much better then I am
