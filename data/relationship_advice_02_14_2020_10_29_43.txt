my boyfriend and I were joking around in the morning, and he took my phone away from me because I was playing something on Youtube and was messing around me with me that he wanted to turn it off. So I went to my laptop to play it on there then I see him going through my phone. I honestly have nothing to hide on there, and I don't get bothered when he does it but it has become exhausting that he feels the need to always go on it. After a while, I see him stopping and being quiet when I asked him what was wrong he wouldn't tell me, but I told him I clearly saw he was upset over something he found on my phone. He asked me what I had Pinterest for(I study/work in fashion so I used it for mood boards) and I explained to him why. Then he shows me a picture of a model I worked with before and that kind of flirted with me when my boyfriend and I were broken up in the summer. He asked me why I searched for him and that I was "obsessed". I told him calmly that a friend of mine jokingly looked him up and was telling me to go find and date him. When I explained that to him he wouldn't listen, called me a liar, asked me to call my friend and ask him when I tried doing that he said anyway my friend would cover for me. Then he starts crying so hard like a baby and starts saying "why, why". He goes into the shower and starts wailing and when he gets out he says I have to ruin the day, even though he's the one that was looking through my phone just to find something. Last week he did the same thing, he found a screenshot from one of my friends that said that his boyfriend wanted to meet me and he jumped to conclusions thinking my friend was trying to set me up with someone. Now he's upset at me saying he won't talk to me for a few days and that I'm disrespecting him and whatnot. I understand why he's upset but this is beyond ridiculous where he's crying so much. Was I wrong in this situation? If I was, please tell me people of Reddit.
