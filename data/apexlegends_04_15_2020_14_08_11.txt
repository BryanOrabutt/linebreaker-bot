So actually this did not happen today it happened a few days ago but I was playing a normal game I logged in and I pressed ready, and then I got paired up with two teammates, one of which the story I will tell you today it is talking about, the the one that I'm going to talking about was a pathfinder he had the 20 kill badge and the 4K badge and he broke off solo the moment we entered the game, I was queuing up with my friend and when he broke off I asked my friend if I could go follow him and he said that would be okay, the ship was heading towards Labs but our teammates broke off and went solo to the Gaunlet. The Gauntlet was empty so we looted peacefully and then we encountered a squad at the bunker of course he did not wait for me and went to fight them straight in I went with him through and I down the one of them and then I got down because I got Focus Fired by the two teammates, he was a good player I'm not going to lie but then after he finishes of the two teammates you can probably guess what he does next he spends the next 3 minutes looting and I almost bleed out ok I'm not the best player in the world but at least rez me so I can help you fight the next squad of course he did not care he just kept looting until I was about to die and then he rezed me last second, after he healed me I started searching the boxes for some meds but of course he took them all so I had to use a phoenix kit, after that he spots more enemies I tell him not to push alone until I heal up a bit but of course he doesn't care he does not even reply he just goes in and pushes solo and of course he gets down instantly, my friend came to help me but we couldn't fight 3 vs 2, not to mention two of them had gold armour, and you want to know what the worst part was that through the entirety of the fight he kept pinging his banner like crazy and that made us even more disorienting and less focused on the fight, and after the match and he just keeps insulting us saying that we are useless and we should have helped him and if we would have helped him push he would have won,at the end he tells us to fck off and leaves. And my question to that pathfinder or to any toxic player out there who does the same thing does this really make you feel good about yourself or about your gameplay?
