Throw away acc. For  context. My boyfriend does not stop liking Instagram photos of other girls in bikinis or girls who wear bras and undies with their tits and nipples out. One time when I uploaded a photo and my leg was in it he called me slutty. I don’t know what to do. He always calls me names whenever I bring up this issue and he tells me he will stop doing it but he constantly goes against his word. He already knows how it makes me feel but he says he doesn’t give a fuck. I have been crying over the same issue for two years now that’s how long we have been together and a year ago when I asked him to remove someone that he has done stuff with he didn’t do it and put up a fight for ages and later on he finally did it and said that it was a sacrifice. He still pays attention to girls that he has flirted with before and claims that they’re just friends and they very clearly aren’t. Ages ago he even said that everybody knows what a like means and no guy will like a girls photo just to be nice every time someone likes something it means that they just want to fuck them and they see them in a certain way and the person receiving the like Knows what it means too and it isn’t seen as though they’re just being nice. This has completely affected my ability to feel desired by him because last time he even follows girls private Instagram accounts and he does this a lot and then when I asked him about it he said because I was just looking and then he realised when he said that he fucked up so then he projected it on me and said “don’t you look at other guys as if you don’t look at other guys” to which I responded no I actually don’t. He said he’s not going to change and he lies and says he will later but keeps doing the same thing. I can’t do it anymore. He gets really aggressive and belittles me and calls me every name under the sun. Then he waits for ME to apologise and come around and acts like nothing happened. I don’t trust him anymore. What do I do. Please.
