Hi. This is only my second post on reddit. I'm a 14 year old boy and I really need help. I've known my best friend my whole life. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me because my parents always say the meanest things and beat me up. She's been there for me from the start and she's all the joy that I've ever wanted. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts almost my whole life and because of the massive amounts of stress I've also go through sleep paralysis a ton. So over the summer my best friend seemed to want to help me more. She eventually found out about my suicidal thoughts and made me promise to her that if they ever grew so strong that I might hurt myself that I should tell her about it and she'd make sure that I would feel better. So it was like that for a while. Eventually school started again and people started saying the worst possible things about her. She has social anxiety and told me that I can help her out by telling her who was saying bad things about her. So I did. And she seemed really upset at them because she thought she could trust those people, because they seemed like such good friends. Then something happened. She kind of snapped and said she doesn't want me anymore. The next few months were so tough but I later found out that one of the people saying horrific things about her and stuff they would do to her told her that I was lying and trying to be possessive. And now I'm stuck with nobody in my life. I need help. I feel so lonely. She was the only love and affection and attention I ever got. I try to go for walks but I get overwhelmed and cry as I walk because it's not the same without her. My suicidal thoughts are becoming too much. I sleep, suffer from sleep paralysis and wake up to no "gmmmm ilyyyy" text. Life just seems like hell on earth. This is only my main problem of many. Does anybody know what I can do? Can somebody help me? Thank you for spending time on me you guys.
