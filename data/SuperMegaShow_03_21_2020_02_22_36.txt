Alright so quick disclaimer before I start this is not a I prefer SuperMega because I don’t agree what Game Grumps are doing I will bring their names up for some points I’ll try to make. And I would also like to apologize if this comes out worded terribly so let’s begin. So I started watching SuperMega the beginning of my junior year of high school which almost 2 or 3 years ago and Game Grumps I discovered around 8th Grade and I thoroughly enjoyed both channels. So around Summer of last year, I had gone and watched a lot older episodes of SuperMega mainly ones where they played games from the sixth generation of consoles, I started finding myself kind of relating to the boys because they would talk they played some of those games as a kid and while there still is a worthy age difference between the boys and myself I played some of those games as well as a kid. And I went back to watch the Grumps play games from that same generation of consoles and didn’t relate to them as much because it seemed they more were playing games because the fans wanted them to also because unlike Matt and Ryan they didn’t seem nostalgic for the game (which I really can’t blame on them). Another point I’d like to bring up is when ever either channel starts a series a brand new, let’s go back in time to when Cuphead was released both channels released their own series on the game (length may vary) and the Grumps seemed to play the game because everyone else was playing it, while you can say SuperMega did it for the same reason it felt more personal because Ryan had mentioned he was excited for the game. My last point (and yet another apology for it being kind of shit) I’d like to bring up is the fact while I enjoy a lots of the series’ from the Grumps it always seems like we see Arin playing most of them while yes both Arin and Dan react to the game I feel like I’m watching Arin react to it more since he’s playing the game, while on SuperMega it’s more balanced as we see more series alternating between both of the boys for example recently we were seeing the boys play Animal Crossing and Vice City while Matt was playing Animal Crossing, Ryan was the one playing Vice City. These are just some points of why I started preferring SuperMega over The Grumps If you agree let me know and if you think think they’re shit let me know why you disagree
