My boyfriend is usually very sweet, it’s just this time he went too far. He kept touching me and stuff the whole day and I told him that I really wasn’t in the mood and he won’t be able to convince me but he kept doing it. I am really attracted to him and I love him, he’s the sexiest man alive in my eyes and I am crazy about him. But I just really wasn’t in the mood, to be point where the thought of being sexual felt repulsive to me. It’s just a point in my cycle where sex isn’t appealing to me. Then when we were watching a movie he started getting handsy and I asked him to stop and he’d stop and then continue. He started kissing me and I liked it so I was kissing him back and I kept rejecting advances for sex so I thought he knew I just wanted to kiss. But he was going too far and I asked him to stop a couple times and he wouldn’t listen to me and then he started fingering me and I got really upset because I kept telling him no. So I started crying because I wasn’t in the mood at all and he apologized and said he didn’t mean to push me. He said he was really sorry and wasn’t thinking right. I wanted to just finish the movie and then he could take me home (I was supposed to stay the night). He took me home and he texted me this morning and said sorry for being an idiot and he wants to move past this. I want to tell him that he needs to respect my boundaries even though we’re dating and very open with each other. but I don’t know exactly how to word my message. Can I have help? And also, this was pretty bad but it’s not a huge red flag right? He never did anything like that before, I guess he was just extra horny. Also a part of me feels kinda stupid for crying and overreacting. We have sex all the time so I can’t blame him for touching and trying stuff, I just wasn’t in the mood then. He’s my boyfriend that I know and love, he’s not like some strange creep so I wish I didn’t cry. So I feel like I need to apologize for that too because it probably freaked him out.
