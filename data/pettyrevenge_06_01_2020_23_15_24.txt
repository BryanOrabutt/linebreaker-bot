This is my first post so sorry for misspells. Also I'm to lazy to reread this so I'm not fixing mistakes.                  Cast: Me, little bro and em.                                                  Back story: I raced dirtbikes most my life so I had different sized racing gear.                                                   So  this  story  happened  on Halloween a few years  ago. Now  my  brother  has  a habit of saying  that "I dont want to go trick or treating this year",then changing his mind last minute "side note it rained the day before Halloween."  So I gave him one of my old racing gear that fit him. When he got dressed i got on my dirtbike with him and drove around the neighborhood getting candy. Then at last we got to em's  house I let my brother get off the bike and go to the door and knock. Em opens the door looks at my brother about to give him candy when she saw the bike then she said in a rude tone "your not in costume your wearing that for safety" I heard that and that shocked me  so I got off and asked her kindly "can you please give my brother some candy and we will leave em "No your not in costume so get off my property!" I smiled hoped on my bike rolled to the closest spot of mud near the door I revved the bike and dumped the clutch mub went all over the place her face window and a bit inside her house needles to say she needed a shower.                                   The outcome my brother and I had a good laugh about it and I hope she learned her lesson.
