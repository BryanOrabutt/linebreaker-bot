Fuck you assholes at school who wanted to kick me out after I spent so much time and money there. Fuck you for turning me into a frightened skittish little kitten. All you miserable pricks in academia. Just because your lives suck doesn't mean you needed to try to ruin mine. I passed by the skin of my teeth but at what cost. It's been 4 years and I still don't sleep right. It was a traumatic experience. I still have nightmares of all you hanging up on me. Except one. God bless you and thank you. Fuck you all. I know you all are lonely aging and miserable. You saw youth and happiness in me and it bothered you so you wanted to squash it out. But fuck you I won't let you. I will continue to love and laugh and you will be miserable. You couldn't break me to pathetic swine. I got the last laugh. I'll get my health back. I'm working on myself. I used to want vengeance. But seeing how you acted towards the younger version of me, I now realize you wouldn't want to hurt some one unless you truly were hurt and broken yourselves. And  now I know this about you. And I laigh. Because how fucked up in the head are you that you though it was ok to do this to someone? The answer is very fucked. you all had one thing in common. Single, old, unhappy. Either by your own narcissism or your own personal demons or the fact that you're just a fucking loser and no woman would touch you with a 10 foot pole. Now I know that you're this fucked up as people I get it. But now it's funny to me. Your pain is funny to me. Rot in it. I won't even damn you to hell because your lives are hell enough and worse of all they are your own doing. From now on anytime I want to cry about what you did to me I will laugh instead. I will laugh at your pain. And that's how I'll get over this. Enjoy your own personal man made hells. God knows the Devil won't do any better than what you've done to torment yourselves.
