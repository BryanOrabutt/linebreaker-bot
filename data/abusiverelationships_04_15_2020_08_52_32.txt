Ever since I was a kid, my older brother has had the tendency to use me in any way possible. It started off with him ordering me to do things for him (like getting him water or doing a chore my mom told him to do) and him hitting me because he was bored and wanted something to amuse him. At first, I didn't think anything of it and I went along with it because of how much I admired him. But as we grew up, it got worse when he hit puberty. He would hit me harder, call me horrible names and neglect me just because he could. And it took its toll. I started to believe that I deserved whatever he did to me cause I wasn't the best brother I could be to him, so I did whatever it took to make him happy. I was his little puppet for him to control. About a year and a half ago, I held a lot of hostility towards him for all the years of mistreatment and I would snap on him during little encounters. It got to the point where our mom had to talk to him and I about our constant fighting and air out where all of this is coming from. So, I told him that ever since we were kids, he would treat me like garbage and how he's still treating me horribly. But he never took responsibility for how he treated me in the past and didn't take responsibility for how his treating me now. Sorry if this triggers anyone, but he calls me a retard, a mong, stupid, any type of name he could say about my intelligence. I will admit that I can be a ditz but growing up with someone I deeply care about saying these things to me, it left me with so many insecurities.  He continues to hit me with intent on hurting me. So, I've hit a roadblock. I have no idea if I want him in my life anymore and it hurts me if I have to cut someone who I love from my life. So I came here to receive some guidance from the people of this community. Should I forgive him just because he has ADHD or should I cut him from my life. Thanks for reading.
