So hear me out.... We are a young team. We are not in the situation that say Pitt is in where we have aging stars and we had better win a cup in the next year or two.    We HAD built some organizational depth. Since the Checkers won the Calder Cup it seems like we've lost most of it.   I agree that Trocheck is a good add and probably what we need.  I do not understand the Skjei trade at all.... He is under contract for a while longer at a pretty high cap hit for a guy that most say is not living up to his contact.  We have to sign Svech after next season and Dougie in a couple of years too.  And if we were going to trade for a rental D why did we trade for someone who is hurt for a while.  In this race for the WC in the east we can't afford to lose games while someone is injured. (since we already have 2 injured RDH) And speaking of that.... When he does come back are they seriously going to start sitting Fluery again?  That kid was the best Defensemen on the ice tonight and he's been getting more comfortable since he's been playing more. And I hated giving up Kuokkanen for a rental as well. I could be wrong but I think he has top 6 potential.  A month ago I was sure that by next year we would probably see Gauthier or Kukkanen take Willy's spot if he retired.  Could we seriously not call up Bean or McKeown?  Why build organizational depth if you aren't going to use it?   Yea I want us to make the playoffs and I could be super wrong about all of these trades but I just feel like we gave up some of our future for maybe barely making the playoffs this year. If Dougie and Pesce are both truly out for the year we have no chance at winning a cup in my opinion and that should be the goal.  As young as we are I just did not agree with these trades.    Maybe I'm crazy.... I feel like the only Cane who wasn't happy yesterday
