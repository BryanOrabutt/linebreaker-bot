This story starts off 2 nights ago at 10pm, my family is sleeping and i decide to let my dogs in because they were crying outside my glass sliding door. But when I open the door there was nothing so i  call for them i heard panting of a dog but their was still nothing. Then my dogs come running down the stairs to me a little after i called for them. I am a little spooked at the panting , so i go outside to look for something. I hear the panting again but still no dog. Im pretty freaked at this but later on i fell asleep and thought nothing of it. Later on i wake up with a spitting head ache so i go into my kitchen to get paracetamol, as im looking for the pills i hear the same panting behind me . I just thought it was one of my dogs but still kind of freaked out, So when I turn around to  confirm what it was one of my dogs there was nothing . Im really scared by now but i need to go to the toilet.  So i call for my dog to gaurd the toilet. I go to the toilet and then I hear a tapping on the house right outside of me ( as the toilet is right next to a window) so i immediately close the window.  Then as soon as I finish i hear a rattling in the kitchen, I rush to the kithen with my dog and then there was nothing but a dish sponge was on the ground. I hear the same disembodied panting from behind me (I could tell it was not my dog as this panting sounded like when you lose your voice but in a panting form) My dog bolts out of that room for some reason i turn around again and there was like all the other times. I am really freaked about this but just try to go to sleep again. I fall asleep without nothing happening for the rest of that night. The next night I wake up again with another splitting headache I go to take some panadol. Then i hear growling behind me I jump at this nearly falling over. I turn around really timidly and then there was  nothing, nothing else has happened since then.
