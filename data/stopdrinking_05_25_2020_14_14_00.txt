On Saturday I saw friends for the first time in months because of lockdown.  I left the house after a minor argument with my fiancée feeling a bit down – and took that as my cue to drink myself into a state of manic derangement by the time I stumbled out to the Uber, which I promptly threw up in.  None of this I can remember.  My fiancée was furious with me and demanded to see my phone, because previously when that drunk I’ve sent ‘hey it’s been too long’ style texts to whichever random girl I find in my phone.  I got all offended and she wouldn’t let it go and then I became hostile and cruel and said horrible things to her, the absolute opposite of what I believe.  She started recording me on her phone so I could see how bad I was, and made me watch it today.  I was utterly aghast at what I saw.  My face was bloated and red, eyes drooping, and what was coming out of my mouth was unspeakably horrid.  Calling her stupid, boring, and beneath me.  I was a total wanker, arsehole, dickhead, bully and c#nt all rolled into one nightmare package.  But most of all pathetic.  I can’t say how much I hate the person I saw.  I couldn’t believe that my own brain had been forming those thoughts and speaking those words.  I grew up with a father who threw everything away with alcohol and mental illness that he refused to get treated.  A brilliant journalist then press secretary with his office literally 10m from the PM’s – then unemployed, divorced and drinking away his talent, leaving us alone and distraught.  I never thought I would ever skirt with that path, but here I am.  Some terrible demon comes out after around 10 drinks, and I can never seem to stay around 2-3.  Sooner or later, maybe after 6 months, it will get out of control and I do stupid, stupid shit and get myself in all sorts of trouble, ruining relationships most of all.  So no more.  Now it’s zero forever more.  No slippery slope for me.  Thanks for reading, and I won’t drink with you today or ever!
