Legit I am so hungry ten it’s been two hours.fir context my parents are divorced and it’s my dads weekend I hate spending time with him for the most part don’t really want to elaborate because most of my reddit posts are about my dad.so it’s Friday evening I get into the car with him and he has the audacity to tell em the weekend plans these plans consist of errands helping him move and hanging out with relatives he knows I hate.so he takes em out to dinner at a place I like while prying about my mental health and gets an Apple. I have been mildly allergic to apples for NINE YEARS but he doesn’t pay enough attention. He criticizes my choice of potato chips to go with my carbs while practically trying to shove this god damn apple down my throat.I DO NOT WANT IT SAM I AM. Then he doesn’t want the Apple he ordered and makes me carry it with me to the stores in the rain. Both of us have physical health issues but he decides let’s just walk like a mile especially in the rain which makes it a lot harder for me to walk.then this man drags me to a bunch of shoppes and the one I want to go into the pet store he pressures me for liek ten minutes to leave.i just wanted to look at hamster information and pick up an information booklet.we finally return to his house where he loudly watches Facebook videos and talks on the phone.i go to bed only to be woken up at 830 where this morning begins.morning is a strong word more like shit show he was talking loudly on the phone the way only a 50 year old Italian man can so of course I was already awake.he then proceeded to yell about how we’re going to be late to some appointment with a painter for his house.he yells from the other room on the phone only stopping to yell speed it up while I was putting my contact lenses on.he makes me drag things to his car and he promises breakfast.that was TWO HOURS ago. I’m not supossed to take my meds without food so I took them before we left because I figured we would eat well we didn’t and we get to his new house where he initiate my yells me to bring approximately 10 lb table legs down to the basement one by one and making sure not to scratch the walls. I can’t really go up and down the stairs two well because of health issues from his genetics! The whole time he’s like fetch me this daughter fetch me that.i finally sit down when the dude leaves and he tells me to get back to work liek food please sir this is breakfast I am so hungry plus I’m getting a headache from my meds how dare you you rat bastard.finally we’re on our way to eat but the entire car ride this man is “teaching me how to drive” while missing his stop every four seconds. I know nobody cares but I am literally starving to death here b ur is this stuff like normal.do your dads do this too or is mine just an anus cake
