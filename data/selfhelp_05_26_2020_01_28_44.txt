So I’m not really sure what you would call this but like for example there’s a girl im talking to, we both like each other but yk still spending time to get to know each other before we date and all, but whenever a convo comes up where she comments on saying like “this person from this show is very hot” or yk that kind of comment I just start to feel very negative, sad, and self conscious. Ig that would just be insecure huh? Either way I hate it and I want to fix it but idk how yet, which is why I’m here. Normally I just say what I’d say if talking to any other person but on the inside I feel as I already discribed but I don’t ever mention it bc 1. Where not even dating and that would be a huge red flag (again trying to fix this) and 2. I’ve been like this in other relationships in the past and I just want to fix it bc it’s very insecure and in a way toxic to be upset bc the person I’m with finds someone else attractive. Ig my issue is I personally don’t feel attractive or wanted so when I see someone else like in a movie or show get it from someone I really care about and want, I get defensive bc I fear losing them. And Ik that’s silly bc it’s an actor in a thing or like a random person but in my head I see it as if they wanted the person I’m talking to they could probably just get them, and that thought scared and worries me as well as makes me feel negative and now that I type that out I realize I need to stop thinking like that lol but also defeat it which again is why I’m coming here for some self help tips😕. I don’t like this about me, it makes me feel terrible and negative as well as partners if I do speak on it bc how can u judge someone for finding someone else attractive Ik I’m not the hottest in the world and even in a relationship u can find ppl attractive just not act on it bc yk u vibe with the other person, I just can’t help feeling how I do even knowing what I just said :(. And it’s not like this happens often but when it does I just wanna react normally and not feel so insecure and defensive/worried about it yk 😔. So if anyone has any advice or anything on this please lmk and thank you all :)
