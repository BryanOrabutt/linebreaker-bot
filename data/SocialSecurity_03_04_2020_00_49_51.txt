My Mother (65) suffers from severe mental issues, has been hospitalized about 20 times in her life, mostly after manic episodes of psychosis and suicide attempts.  My father (65) has been in an out of her (our lives)  and suffers from depression , drug addiction/alcoholism.  For the last 15 years he has stuck around to be her caretaker.  My mom has never worked , but is receiving dependent spouse SS.  My dad is struggling with the normal demands of life, in addition to his own health issues as result of a full lung removal in 2011 on top of  being a caretaker for my mom.  He recently told us that he is not giong to take care of my mother anymore, yet still demands that he is entitled to my mothers SS income because she would not have it unless it was for him.  I created an online SSA account for my mom to get a picture of what her benefit profile looks like and i see that she has a deduction of $43/mo to pay off a balance of over $13k in over payment.  I believe this was due to my dad fraudulently reporting my mothers mariital status, but i am not sure.  Having said all this, what actions should i take in order to maximize my mothers benefits to help get her into an assisted living situation once /if  she is stablized.  I've already applied for guardianship, applied to be a "payee" changed her address.   How can i find out what that overpayment is about?  Can it be waived? Does my mother qualify for SSI?   Is there any way  to  get an increase in my mothers current  SSDI?  Would it be wise  for my mother to divorce my dad?  Both my mom and dad virtually have no assets, no car, no house (they live with a family friend who is basically done with them).  My father recieves \~$1200 SSD and my mother receives $430 minus $40/mo repayment.   I am lost with two kids of my own to take care of and  i live about an hour away from where my parents are.
