So I feel weird even posting here, because I feel like it's not quite the same as some of the traumatic events I've read in this sub..  I was about 22 or 23(f)  I'm 26 now.  I was a virgin.  I met this guy on Tinder, he seemed like a nice normal guy.  Kind of dorky.  I figured I'd give him a chance.  I made it clear in my bio I was not looking for hookups.  He was really into politics, and we went to this woman's house to watch a campaign sort of thing.  Anyway, I was still living at home and we ended up making out outside of his car when he took me home.  He asked me if I was a virgin, and I said yes.  I thought it was weird that he asked/assumed that, but whatever.  Can't remember if it was on the second or third date (if there was a third), but we went downtown and he bought me lots drinks and shots.  He drove, I'm assuming he was sober, definitely didn't have as much as me.  We got to his place, and for some reason in my drunk mind after we got to his bedroom, I thought the right thing to do was have sex with him, because I thought that's what he wanted and expected.  Well he either was really small, or not even hard..  But I know he came like right outside of me.  I was so sore.  I stayed the night, and drove home that morning.  I was paranoid and bought a Plan B.  I remember I texted him and asked him about that night.  He said I initiated it, maybe I did.  I just know I would've never done it sober.  I did not want to lose my virginity to him.  It messed me up for a few months, but eventually I met an amazing guy who is now my husband.  So I don't know if it was rape or not, since I wasn't unconscious and possibly initiated it.  I just wanted an opinion..  I hardly ever think about it, but it pisses me off that he let me get that drunk and have sex with him knowing I was a virgin.  I don't know..
