This was my first age gap relationship. I am 32F and he was 22M. I have always looked much younger than I am and he thought I was his age when we met. He has always been very sensitive and he liked to fight about nothing. I was the one always apologizing and being calm. Anytime there was an issue he would not be able to control his mouth and would say things he shouldn't. I brought this up several times and asked him why we can't just talk like adults. He was very insecure and I went out of my way to make him feel secure and be sensitive to his feelings. What ended things was he felt I keeping something from him and he didn't believe me when I said I wasn't. He of course got upset and started saying things he shouldn't. So I pointed it out to him and told him I don't feel loved when he does that. . That when he says those horrible things they stay in my head. He just went on to try and turn it around on me saying I'm hiding something from him. He has done this in the past and I have just let him but this last time I was sticking to my guns. So, he broke up with me. He said he's not good enough for me and I deserve better. I was so hurt and shocked I didn't say anything. The next day he said he thinks it's for the best and he wishes me the best. That was the most calm he had ever been so in my head he was just DONE. He had posted a few cryptic messages on FB that I just ignored. He then deleted me from Facebook all together. He had told me on several occasions that he was always friends with his exes and that he would with me if we ever split. I asked him about it and he said he was hurting and didn't want anyone to have resentment. We ended things peacefully so I'm so confused. Am I missing something? Did I do something wrong for things to end the way they did? I know I should just move on but it's so hard. I would just like to know what went wrong so I know for the next relationship if I ever date again.
