So this literally happened hours ago...i bought 4 tabs off my cousin 300 each tab but he gave me an extra one (350 on that one). I took one tab and had a good trip. I waited roughly about one week and I took the the 350 one and Had a decent trip. I took one tab and it’s a good and bad trip I’ve gotten. I felt like I needed to explain that to for what I’m about to explain right now. I decided it was well for me to do my makeup and see how artsy I get ( I knew looking in the mirror too long is bad but I ignored it ). it was hard to do a thing because it was too much to process like the feel of the brush and the way your skin looked. I then started getting into doing my makeup and trying to makeup a look for 420 and post it on my insta and sc (wow so gen z) but then I started to enjoy doing my makeup and came to the conclusion that I have to enjoy doing my makeup and I was hyping myself up (example: “Yes bitch you can do any masterpiece on yo face”) but I was just realizing that I have to enjoy the process of my artwork because makeup should be considered something like that. i saw that it was 4pm when I was done with the eye makeup. I went over myself and set a deadline saying “I want to take a picture of this exactly at 4:20 so everyone(sc) can see but then I looked in the mirror and did my foundation so fast that I realized that I should be enjoying this instead of rushing to a deadline that not even good yk. But then I felt like I was forcing myself to enjoy because I felt like I should enjoy it ....so it came down to....I guess I was staring at the mirror too long but I had the mirror effect like if my right eye went 💀 and so I wanted to try to calm myself down but I was alone and I felt like it was getting out of hand and so I called my bf and he told me to go outside and get fresh air and to take deep breaths. It all goes down to this...I don’t know if I got ego death but I felt like I got so into my virtual self. I lack so much self esteem when I was a kid up until I was 14 when I started getting attention, this “confidence” grew and I didn’t realize it was actually ego....I felt like I realized that I like myself in makeup and I appreciate one side of my face with makeup. I just remembered and could only see my left side of my face. I take a lot of pictures with my left side so I felt like it connected. I’m sorry this is a rollercoaster for reading. Anyways I started to take my foundation off because since I didn’t finish the makeup I just decided to take it off and when my right face was done , i felt like I had a bit of control over myself and I looked in the mirror and I saw my right eye and face without makeup and thought I should appreciate myself more like this. But now it’s like been 10 hours ago and I’m still seeing patterns but the scene of the mirror effect on my face keeps replaying in my mind like it’s haunting me.
