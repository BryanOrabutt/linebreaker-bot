I have been back to work for a few months. Initially my work load was pretty low and I came back during a slow time. Now it's crazy and I can't manage it and am not pulling my weight. I work for an amazing employer and won't get fired or anything, but I have very strong work ethic (even though I am typing this on work time...lol...I got here early and already put in 15 minutes of my time off the clock so I am technically not wasting wort time).  I am not meeting my targets and my co-workers are. I work with clients in a social service capacity so I want to give them my best work but can't and it's really hard for me. I know I need to find ways to work more efficiently, but it's hard. My brain just doesn't work like it did before, it takes me longer to do everything. I am burnt out. I have 1 year old twins and a 3 year old. I am exhausted. Last night I left a twin up in his room playing while I went to get the other one from downstairs. I forgot to close his bedroom door when I went to get his brother..the stairs (wood...not carpet covered and soft) are right outside his door. He could have fallen right down them...yes I am beyond grateful he didn't but holy crap...I am a scatterbrain lately and it scares me. I have no downtime or break from it and cannot get it due to my situation (no there's no way...so please don't suggest anything it just is what it is). This is just a shitty feeling. I was feeling so good being back to work but now it's overload and I don't want to be the "mom", the "oh you have young kids" person who can't handle it. I hate working in jobs where there are targets to make. When I worked in retail I liked helping people, but as soon as you put a damn sales target on me I suck. Social service targets are so much worse. Hey, you're supposed to help people, but actually you're really supposed to put on a band aid and get them out the door and it sucks. Anyway, thanks for listening.
