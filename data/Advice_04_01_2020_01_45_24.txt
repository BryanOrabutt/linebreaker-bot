So going back as far as I can remember I’ve always had bad luck with social interaction and relationships. My mother has always been highly manipulative and abusive, coddling and sitting on me one moment then openly beating me while blaming me for all the misfortune that ever happened in her life and guilt tripping me into believing it was my fault which destroyed my self esteem has lead to me wanting an actual emotional connection through other means.                                                             I become very trusting and emotionally vested in friends and romantic interests very easily, and have had people take advantage of that all through high school from having a girl friend attempt to rape me to having a relationship that lasted for four years with my SO at the time take advantage of my emotional immaturity to degrade me and make her feel better all while Building my reliance on her emotionally as the stresses of being a teen right out of high school with no money to go to collage and being not eligible for federal financial aid made it impossible to go to school and not work. She would openly give me affection when it suited her needs but withdraw that effort when she go what she wanted and when I couldn’t offer anymore she left and I broke me I felt like an empty shell, most of my friends thought I was a lost cause and to this day I have the same group of four friend that stood by my side and nurses me back to health. It took me a long time to be able to balance that out so I could operate normally in day to day life. This is where my life is split in two I can talk to people for the purpose of working and surviving everyday life and I can do that well. I don’t have any self confidence when it comes to my actual personality so I’ve built a social facade, a mask I hide behind that keeps me from getting hurt and the only time I drop that mask is with my four close friends ( I don’t even drop it for my family)It has led to me being successful in anything I’ve tried doing and now I’m pursuing a successful military career because it’s always been my dream. I just bought a car and already payed most of it off. I have a sizable retirement account payed off am successful at school with decent grades(I’m still no A student) but after my abusive Ex left me almost 5 years ago I didn’t have anybody to share me experiences with, and with my friends group slowly moving on with their own lives I fell back into a hopeless romantic ideology and downloaded tinder because I don’t  know where to start with the dating scene anymore. Matched with a few people but they always ghosted me for almost a year until I PCSed to my new duty station where I matched with a very  cute girl who was interested in a lot of the same things as me and we kicked it off. I forgot how fun it was to interact with romantic intent and eventually she ended up sending sexually explicit pictures I was caught completely and my facade started to break I didn’t now how to respond to I pushed away to slow things down a bit because we had both been looking for meaningful relationships. After that we went on a date she made dinner at her house, (wasn’t at my place because I live in barracks) and cuddled for a few hours watch and laughing playing with her cat and watching anime. After which she got quite and avoided eye contact and conversation which I took as sign I might not want to overstay my welcome and offered to leave to let her get some sleep, which she was grateful for but also very sorry that I would be leaving early. I said it was fine we kissed and I drove back to the barracks. After that she slowed down her texts and it was clear she lost interest for some reason (which is fine) so I asked and confirmed it and she immediately blocked me afterwards. Kind of a bummer not going to lie but the real thing that surprised me was how much it hurt. I hadn’t even formed a real attachment to this girl but yet all the pain built up from every fail relationship from my abusive ex all came out. It hurts so much and I have an empty longing for something. To be clear it’s not for my most recent date I just hadn’t realized that I had been so hurt and destroyed by my past. That there was that much damage, and now I’m kind of hopeless I don’t know if I’ll ever be in an emotional state to have a function healthy relationship, and I’m not going to try dating again for the foreseeable future  because it’s not fair to anyone I would end up dating to have to carry all my emotional baggage and deal with the outcome. I don’t know how much longer I can carry this burden on my own however. I feel more and more like an empty shell a machine of a man, I hurts whenever I smile at work I know I’m lying to myself and that inevitably I don’t want to keep up a facade any longer, but I can’t socially operate without one. For all my false confidence and bravado leading to physical success it can’t lead me to a family of my own and it’s eating me alive. I know this post is a cluster F and probably scattered, but I just need to get this out and here what others have to say. At the very least thank you for reading this far.
