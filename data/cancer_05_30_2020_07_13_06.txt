I lost my daddy this morning. Cancer took over his whole body, it came aggressive and strong. To think that I only knew a part of what he was going through because he asked my mom to not let us see him in so much pain breaks my heart. To me, everything I saw was already so heartbreaking and painful to watch, my mom told me it was so hard for her to make excuses to get us out of the room for him to let his body just tense up in pain. At times he would tell me “hey mama can you step out of the room, I have to go potty” in reality his pain was coming in and it was so strong he couldn’t bear have us watch him go through it. His last two days he was gone and he was agonizing in pain but he was not all there and he could no longer talk to ask us to go outside for a bit, watching him was the hardest thing I’ll ever go through in my life. I am at peace knowing that during his last few hours he seemed so peaceful and I did not see his body tense up in pain any longer. He went so fast, I saw him take his last breath but he wasn’t gasping for air, he just gave one last breath and he was gone so peacefully. I love him so much, I told him so many times “I’m so happy you’re my dad, I love you and I know you love me too even if you can’t say it back anymore.” I am thankful for this page because although I never posted I read through everything hoping to be more prepared for this journey with my dad and everything that came along with it. My best wishes to everyone here, cancer is just fucken shitty. Please whatever part of the journey you are in never leave your loved ones, love them, love them so much and give thanks for every new day that you get with them even if it’s a shitty day. Soak in every single day you get with them, when the time comes let them go, let them be at peace and free from this horrible illness.
