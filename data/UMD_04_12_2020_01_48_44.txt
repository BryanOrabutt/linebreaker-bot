So these are the only two colleges I have been accepted to and wanted to major in comp sci. I got accepted into UMD for comp sci but stony brook was limited and they accepted me to a general major and said I had to choose so I chose bio which im kinda interested in. Maryland did not offer any aid so I would be paying 37k for tuition and then 13k for housing and then food would be like $900 a month and its that much tuition because im out of state. Stony brook on the other hand offered money and since im instate with the money, I basically got a full ride but id be a bio major and id prob have to go into med school even though I like learning about bio I cannot see myself as a doctor. Other schools out of state were more expensive and upstate schools I could not see myself going there and the rest like NYU or Fordham would be more expensive then Maryland. Id be commuting to stony brook also so I wouldn't be in debt but as a bio major. Should I take out loans to cover the costs or should I just be a bio major and do maybe do Med. Doctors do make a lot of money so that would be a key motivating factor. Im just lost and don't know what to do. I went to community college already and so these are literally my only options as I could not get into other top tier schools, I could not get aid from closer schools like NYU and upstate I cannot see myself there and did not like any school one bit. Also Maryland is a party school and with a large community and Id be making friends and I also heard stony brook is a commuter school with the people being social awkward nerds as its a stem school. Idk I just want to make the right choice. What should I do? Even If I went to stony as a bio they told me I cannot change majors. So its either 50k a year at UMD or free ride stony but then id have to go to med school which is 300k in debt but I would rather not be a doctor but it would be motivating since I would get lots of money to pay it off. What should I do?
