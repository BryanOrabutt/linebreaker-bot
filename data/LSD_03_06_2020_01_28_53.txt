So later this month I have the opportunity to candy flip at a concert. I’ve rolled plenty of times at shows so I’m super comfortable with that but I’ve only tripped once at one. The one time I did trip, I only took half a tab expecting it to be very mild and kind of just give me that energetic feeling, but it hit much harder than I was expecting and it kind of threw me off for the night. The problem is that it wasn’t too intense, but that I had drove almost 3.5 hours to this show by myself and with it hitting harder than I was expecting I sort of just felt off and awkward the whole time I was there. I’ve gone to plenty of shows sober but for some reason I couldn’t really get into the music and the vibe like I usually can even sober, I think too much was just going on in my head. As background I’ve only tripped like 8 or so times and have never taken more than one tab, one usually does me right. Went off on a tangent there but back to this situation, I’ll be with a large group of friends at this next show this time and everyone will pretty much either be tripping, rolling, or both. I’m just curious to know what are the effects of candy flipping. Will it be like a normal trip but then once the molly starts kicking in, will it just be really euphoric with that acid headspace? More or less visuals with the combo? Does one drug usually overpower the other? My plan was to take half a tab and then between 150-200mg of mdma. My usual dosage for molly is 200mg, I’ve never gone higher because I don’t want to become dependent on a higher dose and 200mg was how much I’ve took the first tome I rolled. Mdma of course makes you super social, but on the other hand acid makes me less sociable so will the mdma over ride it? Last question, what’s the proper timing for candy flipping, like which substance to take first and approximately how long between taking each substance? Sorry this is a lot of questions lol. Thanks
