so pets are great and all but I think we can all agree they take way too long too long to level them up. some YouTubers have even said that for legendary you basically need 25 skill levels worth of exp to get it to level 100. so my suggestions are: A new skill. this would be something like pet affinity or something, it would get exp from levelling up pets.1 level = 1 exp, then you would need 5 exp for the first level, 10 more for the second level, and so on. each level would give +.2% pet exp from all sources, so a total of +10% exp at level 50. this wouldn't drastically change anything, but it would make it easier to level pets up. also adding pet affinity potions, +20% exp from all sources (buy from the travelling zoo event for 3 super eggs and 1 mil) then the wilderness would have an area for pet games. these would be games like the harp that give a set amount of pet exp every time you play, but they would cost energy. energy would be the 2nd thing the pet affinity skill would give you. 50 base at lvl 1 + 2 every level. each game would cost 5 energy and give 1% of the pets experience that's needed to level up. you could also give armor sets to boost energy and stuff. the last thing would be breeding. this would allow you to mix 2 pets talents together. the talents wouldn't be as good, obviously. (around 1/2 as good as normal) and the pet would only get 1 or 2 talents from each pet. you can also breed 2 of the same pet together for a better version of that pet, for example, 2 ender dragons could give you +.02 to all stats per level. breeding would cost 10000 coins x 1,1.5,2,4,10 based on the rarity. (10000 for common, 15000 for uncommon, 200000 for rare, 40000 for epic, and 100000 for legendary), for each pet. meaning if you breed 2 legendaries it's 200000, a common and an uncommon is 25000, etc. breeding also doesn't guarantee success just like rjnecrafting. anyway that's it thanks for reading. plz give suggestions for improvements or let me know if I should scrap the whole idea lol.
