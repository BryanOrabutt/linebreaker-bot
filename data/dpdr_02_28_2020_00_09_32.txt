welp, i wanna get everything off my chest and the insecurities i don't wanna anyone acknowledging or the 'elephant in the room', i struggled with GAD since early 2016, i had my first panic attack when i was sleep deprived and i have to admit it was all my fault, i was staying up 24 hours every once or two days a week and drink a lot of caffeine a day, but hey, i was 14 what did i know? i had my first dpdr episode like a month after getting diagnosed with GAD, i was alone playing basketball down the block and i don't know why, i was literally distracted playing ball and next thing i knew i felt really weird and got so scared i ran and some strangers helped me and dropped me off home, i felt like i was gonna die, 2-3 months later i'm doing therapy but i can't even focus on the therapy sessions cause i hate enclosed places i would constantly look another way and twist my hair and it would look like some tweaker shit that a druggie would be doing, i never smoked or did any drugs, got put on prozac, it "cured" me, cool, life feels normal again, got off a year later in summer 2017,  dated a girl a month later , around september 2017 i was up late and i don't know why i started thinking about it but i started questioning reality and felt weird and was scared, didn't fall asleep till 6 am, wake up and i still feel weird, but it was manageable i was still able to go to school and focus if i controlled myself, around the end of march 2018, i'm still with that girl, i had a really really bad cold and my anxiety and everything becomes 20x worse when i'm sick and it was one of her friends birthday party's, i wanted to go but i didn't feel good at all, i'm a very antisocial person so i always prefer to stay home and her and my mom in law just told me to go and said fuck it and went, we got to boondocks and soon as i got out i had the worst panic attack with a dpdr episode that i ever experienced, she went in with everyone else and i just got back in the car cause her friends mom who's sons birthday it was dropped us off and i was hyperventilating i called my mom and my dad picked me up, i felt slightly better with him but i had the intense dpdr feeling the rest of the day, girlfriend was pissed, always told me i fucked up and ruin shit, she comes over that same night to stay over and then she says " i would have never dated you if i knew you had anxiety" ah, at that time i thought it was really my fault and start taking prozac again, i broke up with her cause of what she said, bitch was on my dick begging for a 2nd chance a week later, we get back together a month later and the prozac once again helped the dpdr, everything is fine, the dpdr is under control, i got off prozac again like in the beginning of 2019 and a month later i broke up with her after like a year and a half of dating because she was getting really toxic and manipulative and always wanted me at her house and if i wasn't there she would assume i was cheating, anyways, literally 2 weeks later she's dating some new guy that was one of her "guy friends" and i kinda missed her for a month or two after we broke up and she ended up cheating on him and he found out and blah blah he forgave her and they got back together and we cut contact i moved on haven't checked up on her in a long time, anyways i meet this new girl around april let's call her beck, anyways me and her got along really good, we never dated but that was honestly my fault, i never settled down and i wish i did, me and her stop talking cause she got tired of me leading her on late july and at that same time i got sick really and again, i had my 2nd worst dpdr attack, felt better a couple days later, school started, but this time it's more of a fear being alone, like agoraphobia? like i can be around students, teachers adults but i would have tnis constant feeling of anxiety feeling on edge of having a dpdr attack because i wanted someone i know very well ljke my mom or two of my super close friends with me near me cause i don't even know why i feel this way, it's still the case till today, i stopped going to school cause of it, 2 months later, beck added me on facebook again, a week later she kills herself, i should've messaged her, i could go on and on of how much i regret with her and how i wanted it to be different but it's not gonna do shit, went to her funeral a week later, i duh myself into a spiral of depression, i cried everyday about her, saw my doc and she switched me from prozac to zoloft, and i feel like its making it worse, i've been on this pill for nearly 3 months now and i don't feel any better besides not crying or excessively thinking about beck, but the anxiety is still there id say it helped it a little but not as much as prozac did and now the way i live my life is literally staying at home everyday; my mom stopped trying to force me to do something with my life, i get so frustrated with myself cause there's stuff i wanna do like get a job and go out ALONE and not have to have someone with me all the time with me, i get scared cause i haven't seen anyone anywhere have the same shit going on as me, honestly, i'm getting kinda tired, i just wanna feel like a normal human and not stay at home all day locked up in my room doing nothing i feel so bad about myself but it's so hard to push myself without freaking myself out, i just want a a NORMAL FUCKING LIFE. the thing i wanna fix the most is the fear of being alone outside, like school or going somewhere or if i were to get a job, like fuck ill handle the depression, my constantly tormented mind, just to not fear being outside like a normal HUMAN it's been 4 years since this has fucked with me and i want OUT and i wanna FIX IT fuck suicide i'm not gonna let this shit fuck up the potential i have, someone please help me.
