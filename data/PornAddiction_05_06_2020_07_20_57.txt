My girlfriend has lost so much trust for me because of my porn addiction. When ever I relapse, she says just say and we’ll work though it but all my life it has been so intertwined with lies, lying to my family etc. I need to stop or at least be honest but I’m scared, each time it hurts her a little more yet each time I don’t want to say because I’m scared she’ll think less of me, and it will push her down a deeper and deeper dark rabbit hole. I don’t want to do that to her not in my wildest dream but I’m so scared. Each time I think I can sort it on my own, it’s just this one time but we all know they add up. I love her with all my heart, i don’t go to porn because she is not enough and I want her to realise that but she doesn’t and I can’t blame her, it would seem like that to anyone in a relationship. I love her more than she realises. A few weeks ago, I said “I wouldn’t watch because I know what it does to you and I don’t want you to go through that because I love you” and I just feel if i tell her then it under valued that. It will mean I don’t love her and that I want to see her hurt. When I was younger I sat and thought I’d be able to give up once I have a girlfriend but it’s so much harder than I ever imagined. So many things in the world just push you back to it. Instagram, after years of using it for softcore stuff, now I want to stop it has it constantly on my explore tab no matter how much I say not interested. Snapchat has pornstar literally on their story pages, probably again from years of me looking but there is so many other places like that. I’ve been good for months been doing so well but it’s hard and these don’t help. Trouble is that they are so integral for life nowadays I dare not delete them. I’m scared each time I’m going to loss her and I know the next time will be it. I never want to hurt her that’s why never want to say but not saying makes it worse. I need to sort this and man up.
