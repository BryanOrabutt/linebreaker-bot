I had a gf, i met her over the summer at a summer camp and we had biology together, and we got close pretty fast and started dating eachother like within a month or so of really talking to eachother, and to me she was perfect, everything i could dream. She’s so fucking adorable and she’s so cool i mean she’s perfect she’s super smart and she’s just super fun and cool and she pole vaults and rock climbs like that’s badass as fuck, and just like everything about her was perfect. I guess i got attached pretty fast and i liked her a lot more than she liked me or whatever idek but all the sudden she started giving me like 1 or 2 word answers and hardly talking to me, and then broke up with me a week later. She said it was because she was so busy with all her sports, and after some very not fun for me conversations, i’m realizing all this, i messed up i definitely got too attached too soon and i said stuff i should have waited to say, and now i’m hurt so bad because i’m like nothing to her anymore she’s going on normal hell shes probably happier than before, and doesn’t have a care about me, and she doesn’t even want to be friends and she was rude the whole time which is just super unlike her and now it’s been like 2 weeks and i’m still fucked up and i don’t know what to do, i’m trying to hangout with my friends and i’m trying to like ignore it and now that we have 3 weeks off school i guess it’ll be good for me to not see her so i can get her off my mind but honestly it’s all i can think about i’m trying but like fuck it dude, she was so incredibly perfect and i fucked it up. Idk what i was hoping to do with this post maybe get advice how to get over it idfk. We’re probably gonna be working together at that summer camp this summer so and i just wanted to be friends at the very least but it’s not looking like that and i just wanna die man i just hate this. I’ve had a lot of gfs but she’s just perfect different from every other one and i’ve never been so hurt from a relationship that was this short i mean it was like 2 months of dating on top of 1 or 2 months of talking/flirting, and i feel like i just lost my kids in a divorce. Just fuck it all man
