My husband and I love playing ranked together. He taught me a lot about the game and when I was going to college, it was nothing but school and Smite. I am not going to say I'm an amazing Smite player or that I only want to play with amazing people, but starting season 7, I'm stuck in a really bad loop and my mmr is going down more and more. I can carry a game but only if the team doesn't feed and they use their wards. In this bottom queue they dont. They took off duel queue and forced me to play ranked by myself at some point last year that's when my mmr crashed and it got so bad now it won't let us play together. Unfortunately I used my own picture as my profile picture, when I was playing and I tried to talk on mic to try to strategize with people. No one took me seriously because I'm a woman. It even got so bad that I would get blamed when clearly it was not my fault. I've had players say "Every game with a girl, we lose." and when I carried, they deliberately tried to throw the game just to say girls can't play. I've had people ping me countless times for stuff that wasn't my fault, for instance I'm level 2 Nu Wa, jungle is hanging out in enemy jungle, gets killed by the mid and jungle and they proceed to ping me the whole game making fun of that fact that I'm a woman on Smite. So I took my picture off. Now I get pinged 95% less. But now in ranked, Xbox, mind you, I have this embarrassingly low ELO/MMR/WHATEVER and it's like I'm stuck in queue hell. I kinda want to stop playing the game, even though it is one I really love and enjoy playing but I just got so frustrated about this... I didn't cry but got pretty emotional over the fact that there are people in ranked that don't know the basics. I find it hard to understand why they are even in ranked. Anyway, I'm stuck now in a really super low mmr so if someone is in the same boat with me, very good player, just needs someone to play with, on Xbox let me know. I need help!
