To start this off I am an 18 year old male, I weigh about 160lb so I’m relatively skinny.. anyways I have been feeling nauseous for quite some time now, maybe a month and a half of just feeling like crap tbh.. I wake up in the morning everyday feeling very sick to my stomach, and it’s really hard to eat or drink anything in the morning because of this. Eventually though the nausea dies down a little bit and I’m able to eat something. Once dinner time hits, I am pretty hungry though and can eat a lot. After I eat I still feel nauseous and a little hungry even after I eat a ton. The nauseous feeling gets better throughout the day mostly. I have had problems with nausea before in the past, maybe a year ago I’ve been to the hospital but the doctors said it was acid reflux, (I had other complications other than nausea though) but this I think is much more severe than acid reflux now. On top of that, what they said to take is a pill called “Pepcid” I could say that it makes me feel a little better, but the nauseous feeling is still always there. This feeling actually stopped for a few days and then all of a sudden just comes back in full effect. I also get these feelings in my stomach of it just tightening up like it’s in a knot (best way I could describe it) towards the middle of my stomach that doesn’t let go for awhile. There were 2 separate times where I was throwing up a lot, and it was after I took this medicine that helps with motion sickness (it was what my dad found) and the other time was when I took Pepcid. Also, I haven’t lost any weight. I still live with my parents and they’re the ones that take care of me so they have the say so on if I go to the doctor and they think it’s acid reflux because that’s what the doctor said a long time ago 🤦🏻‍♂️ so they don’t seem too concerned. And with everything going on and hospitals being packed I just don’t see them taking me. The only other thing that bothers me is I get headaches occasionally, but not everyday or near that. I would appreciate any type of advice. I really need it at this point, maybe something could help this feeling ease up a little or potentially get rid of it
