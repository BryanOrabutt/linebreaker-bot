I tried it for the first time yesterday but idk what happened? The whole experience lasted about 15-20 mins, I‚Äôm not sure of the exact mg I was given (someone else packed it up for me) I had a small one first and started to see some slight visuals like on LSD, started feeling like someone was switching bodies with me and then switching back and it was just so weird, even though I was sitting in the same room with my eyes open I felt like we keep moving to different times and everything just ‚Äúmade sense‚Äù for a second, it was so weird. Very similar to my LSD experience but it felt more like someone else was controlling it. I had a second hit, a bigger dose this time and I didn‚Äôt close my eyes. For some reason I was fighting it, I don‚Äôt know why, I can barely remember what happened now, but I was fighting with my ego and it was like I was trying to free a version of me but my ego kept pushing her down. It was like I was resisting my ego and trying to let this other being out??? And I‚Äôm not sure if this actually happened but I was with 2 other people and one of them was talking but all I could hear was my thoughts and at the exact moment I thought something they would say it and it was like he was the voice in my head talking to me??? There‚Äôs no way he could have known what I was thinking?? Were my thoughts actually being projected through his words? and holy fuck it was scary to meet that other version of me and now I don‚Äôt know how to access her??? Does this all make sense??? I‚Äôve read a lot of experiences and everyone seems to have very meaningful experiences and go to all these cool visual places, I feel like if anything I met a new me and they were trying to battle for control of my mind for a few minutes. It felt so fucking weird. Idk if I‚Äôm just not ready or wtf is wrong with me ü§£ Has anything like this happened to anyone else??? Sorry it‚Äôs so hard for me to put into words what happened!
