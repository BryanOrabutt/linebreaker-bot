Over the past couple of years I’ve played and completed a variety of different games from different genres. For example single player open world games like Assassins Creed, Far Cry, God of War, HZD, Batman Arkham, Spider-Man, Days Gone, Witcher 3 etc. there’s loads more to your typical yearly COD to JRPG games like Persona 5, Nier etc. and also smaller games like A Way Out, A plague tale innocence and also MMORG like FF XIV. I’ve completed most of the triple AAA titles available on the PS4 currently, but there a few I haven’t. One of them games would be the Dark Souls series and typically that genre of games, I’ve played all the Dark Souls, Nioh, Bloodborne and Sekiro but have never managed to progress in any of them due to  the games well for me being extremely difficult, I’m a massive fan of this genre of games and have always wished the above games would come with difficulty settings for a player like me so I could enjoy the game and not settle to watching playthroughs/cutscenes on YT but no matter how many times I try I can never make it past the first few hours in each of the game. It’s a shame really, I know them games are uniquely designed to be challenging but as a massive fan of each of the games and the genre in whole no matter what I try I really suck at them games, I know it’s my skill level of gaming that hinders that and not the games it self as if they games did have difficulty settings it would dilute the experience. So when Ghost of Tsushima was first announced a few years ago I thought to myself ‘great, another one of them games I can’t wait to play and I wish I’ll be good at but know that won’t be happening’ so wasn’t really excited about the game, sure I watched all the trailers and gameplays but seeing how the game falls under the same category as the Dark Souls games I wasn’t really hyped for it at all but recently when Sucker Punch announced the game will have various difficulty modes I was ecstatic and preordered the game straight away! I know some people are happy with this while others are not but I just wanted to share my opinion.
