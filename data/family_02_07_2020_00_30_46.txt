For my entire life, I was under the impression that my brother and I were not close. We always fought when we were kids and he has some anger management issues and once he got really mad at me (I have no idea why) and threatened to kill me. I recall one day he came home and angrily stomped to my room and I was so scared so I locked the door and he used scissors and made marks on the door (the marks are still there to this day). When he left for college, we got closer in the sense that he tells me a lot of stuff he doesn't want our parents to know (which must mean he trusts me?), but in terms of actually being closer I feel like we still aren't. When he comes home from college, sometimes he's really moody and speaks to me rudely for no reason, and other times he comes into my room and expects me to drop everything to talk to him. I recently spoke to him and he says he always thought we were VERY CLOSE when we were kids and inside I was like holy smokes dude I thought you wanted to kill me. I'm really scared b/c I recently applied under a binding plan to the college he goes to despite him saying he DOES NOT want me to go to the same school as him multiple times (he doesn't know I applied binding tho), but I really like this school so I want to go, and assuming I was so fortunate to get in, I am terrified about what our relationship will become. He has provided me good advice throughout high school but I didn't think it was fair that he could stop me from going to whatever college I want to go to. I feel like if I did get in, he's going to be EXTREMELY angry for a long time, and if he is, I'm honestly thinking about just cutting him out of my life b/c I can't handle his unpredictable moods anymore, but I also really don't want to cut him out of my life. I'm just tired of being scared of him and having to tolerate his random anger all the time.
