so a few months back i had posted that i was going through some stuff with an ex of mine, we broke up on Christmas day and it threw me for a loop, we tried being friends and that didn't work well for me. she at first was crying and shit like me, but what really concerned me was the fact that she was getting drunk (while we were together she had told me she hated the thought of alcohol) and high all the time, after a while she started laughing in my face when i said i wasn't gonna go out there to see her because inside i wanted to distance myself from my past for a little while and began to insult me for whatever reason saying i was pathetic and a loser saying i had not a single chance to get back with her, that broke me.. a lot but days later i decided to block her on everything and it all became clear that i did the right thing, about 9:00 that same night she hopped on her alt account on Facebook and berated me with insults and said that life isn't a fairytale we cant just go back and fix it. and told me to grow up i agreed with her and i left it at that,(i blocked that account too) two months down the line and it still haunts me. the memories spending the summer at my moms house her and i smoking pot at 3am in the front yard, the midnight runs to cumberland farms for food and coffee and the weddings she took me to. i met so many family members. but in the back of my mind i know im better off because of the times when we werent happy shed be really rude and insult me and ignore me for hours. and my first time visiting her house she had literally admitted to me she cheated on all of her exes before me.. what me different am i right? but honestly im lost and dont know what to do. some days i miss her and others im okay. i have moved on with now what i assume a girlfriend but im not sure where we really stand but it really bugs me. any advice?
