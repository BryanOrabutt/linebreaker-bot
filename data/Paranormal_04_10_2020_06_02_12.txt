R/paranormal So to start off I’d like to tell y’all that me and my brother are close to five years apart and used to live in this little trailer house in a town not to far from the town we live in now , a few weeks back my brother and had his girlfriend and his friend over for a fire and to spend the night , as the night progressed we ate food and sat around a fire and started telling scary story’s as one dose at a camp fire , my brother’s girlfriend had asked the group “what’s something spooky that has happened to you guys” , everyone says there’s and then it’s my brothers turn to tel a story , my brother says “ one time when I was like five when we lived in our trailer house I woke up late at night to take a pee and I saw a demon covered in fire at the end of the hallway “, at that moment I was basically shocked in disbelief but chose not to say anything in fear that no one would believe me , I had seen the same thing ig I’m gonna call it an entity because I can picture it in two forms in my head , but fast forward and my mom and her bf left to go to the store or something and a fire had started in the kitchen bc my baby sister hadn’t put out a cigarette all the way and caught something on fire ig (she was a sus bitch and was involved in a previous house fire so I don’t know if I believe it was a “ accident” ) but when we were leaving the house out the back door I had dropped one of my favorite stuffed animals and instead to go back for it in the living room since it wasn’t on fire in there and how the house was built there was one long hall way with all the rooms in that hallway the bathroom happing to be the first one of them , I swear on everything I saw this like huge floating on fire eyeball look at me and it was the most terrifying shit I have ever seen and I booked it from there , I also can see it as a medium height man all on fire with a pair of medium length horns that were also on fire, idk if he will ever know or see this but that was terrifying
