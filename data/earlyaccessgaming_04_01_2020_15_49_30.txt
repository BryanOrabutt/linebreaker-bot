 I dont like these early access games they do on steam. They get everyone to buy these half a\`\` done games, I play em', beat em' and don't come back. Why would I come back to a game I already played and beat before? Because you added a few things that werent there before? Nah, I'm done buying early access games.  They really need to stop doing this, it's horse sh\`t to the gamers. I've got like at least 15 games on my steam account that are f\`ckin not even done. Serrin Fate, Undermine, Universim, Stone Shard, just to name a few, and MORE. Everytime I see an undone game on steam for sale, it's a slap to the face. Might as well try to market me sh\`t half a\`\` games on my cell phone, like the Chinese, at least they are straight up and honest about it.   Early access games should be free, if you're going to release a half a\`\` game, it should be FREE until release, PERIOD. OR Don't release the game until its 100% done. What happened to that? Huh? As Ramsay would say, "YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, YA DONKEY. F\`ck me!" It is literally equivalent to any nasty kitchen you see on "Kitchen Nightmares." And they wonder why people aren't playing it or coming to that nasty restaurant to eat. They wonder.   This is why games like Fortnite are the most popular. You know why? Because they don't release half a\`\` sh\`t. I hate Fortnite and I don't play it myself, but I have tried it before and I must say, it was the most tuned and you can tell the level of work and care that goes into it, compared to other BRs, like half a\`\` Realm Royale, for example.   Wake up developers, we don't want half a\`\` games. If it takes you another year to finish it, take another year to finish it. I don't want a half a\`\` "cooked dish." You see what I'm saying? Zzz The gamers will pay the money... too, if you do a good job. Look at rockstar... They take their time... Imagine if Red Dead Redemption 2, for example, was "early access." You know how much of a turn-off that would've been? I would've quit the Rockstar franchise THEN AND THERE. $60 dollars for that GTA V clone that they turned into an old western theme. $60!!! And you know how many copies they sold? Just saying, a well prepared cooked dish, is what people want. We will pay the money too. We don't care who the chef is, as long as he can f\`ckin' cook.   In conclusion, I don't know why this guy is making all these build videos. I'm not gonna come back and play this game again, don't care how much you add or what changes or what. You know why? Because my 1st experience with Stone Shard, was, "This is half a\`\` and imba, but I'll force myself to finish it anyways." Like eating a rubbery fu\`kin' steak. Forcing it down, and this guy expects me to come back for round 2? .I..    1st impressions are everything and I've been buying all these early access games, yet I haven't had 1 good first impression, WITH ANY OF THEM. All I've learned to do now, is never buy an early access game again. It could be in my library, in that "early access" stage for YEARS, and I'll never play it again. The truth is, they just wanted the money asap. That's greed. That's another slap to the gamer's face. Stop being greedy f\`cks. Produce QUALITY and stop releasing it early, like some 16 year old virgin boy on prom night
