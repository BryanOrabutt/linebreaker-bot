Hello I have some questions regarding my final paycheck from my previous employer. I was employed at a franchised business in Denver, Colorado. I submitted my notice to my employer and they accepted it. I did not show up for my final workday due to weather and my desire to spend that time on some homework. I was not on any sort of contract and was made aware that Colorado is an at-will employment state. According to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, “When an employee voluntarily quits or resigns, they are to receive their wages and compensation, due and payable, upon the next regular payday. They may be paid by check, cash, or by direct deposit as on any other payday.” and “For the purpose of timely payment of wages, it is the policy of the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics that an employee has quit or resigned in the instance where he or she has not shown up for work as scheduled.” I received my pay stub from my employer that stated I was to be paid on the 20th of Feb. I did not receive my direct deposit on the 20th of Feb. “Deduction for the amount of money or the value of property that the employee failed to properly pay or return to the employer in the case where a terminated employee was entrusted during his or her employment with the collection, disbursement, or handling of such money or property. In this instance **the employer shall have 10 calendar days** after the termination of employment to audit and adjust the accounts and property value of any items entrusted to the employee **before the employee's wages or compensation shall be paid** in accordance with C.R.S. 8-4-109.” I waited the allotted amount of time and then sent a demand letter asking to be paid my final paycheck. The demand letter was sent via certified mail and arrived Monday, March 9th. I know this because my employer texted me on that day and said, “I got your letter. Your check has been sitting here at the store ready to be picked up the whole time. You were to pick it when you returned your shirt.” According to the Colorado Department of Labor and employment, “Where the wearing of a particular uniform or special apparel is a condition of employment, the employer shall pay the cost of purchases, maintenance, and cleaning of the uniforms or special apparel.” Furthermore, "An employer may require a reasonable deposit (up to one-half of actual cost) as security for the return of each uniform furnished to employees upon issuance of a receipt to the employee for such deposit. The entire deposit shall be returned to the employee when the uniform is returned. The cost of ordinary wear and tear of a uniform or special apparel shall not be deducted from the employee's wages or deposit.” I did not receive any such receipt of a deposit for my uniform. I am wondering if the withholding of my final paycheck because I have not returned my uniform is a valid reason? If it is not a valid reason can I file in small claims court? According to Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 8-4-109 subsection 3 paragraph B, “If an employee’s earned, vested, and determinable wages or compensation is not paid within fourteen days after the written demand is sent in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this subsection (3), the employer shall be liable to the employee for the wages or compensation, and a penalty of the sum of the following amounts of wages or compensation due or, if greater, the employee’s average daily earnings for each day, not to exceed ten days, until such payment or other settlement satisfactory to the employee is made: (I) One hundred twenty-five percent of that amount of such wages or compensation up to and including seven thousand five hundred dollars; and (II) Fifty percent of that amount of such wages or compensation that exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars. (c) If the employee can show that the employer’s failure to pay is willful, the penalty required under paragraph (b) of this subsection (3) shall increase by fifty percent. Evidence that a judgment has, within the previous five years, been entered against the employer for failure to pay wages or compensation is admissible as evidence of willful conduct.” Does the employer's text message to me show that he has willfully refused to pay my final paycheck? I appreciate all of your help in determining if filing in small claims court is the proper action given the evidence I have against my former employer.
