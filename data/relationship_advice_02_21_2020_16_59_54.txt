Hello everyone, so I am not sure where to start, so I will start from the beginning. Me and my ex broke up around August of last year, we been together for 4 years. The reason for the break-up was that she didnt feel capable of a relationship and needed to work on herself. So we seperated and I cut contact for a few months. One day I decide to check up on her. We talked and she told me she has been feeling worse after the breakup and that her depression is through the roof. So I helped her by talking to her and trying to point her in the right direction. She asked to hangout one day and I said sure, feeling how I am in a right state of mind. She came over and we chatted and she broke down... Alot. I listened to her and talked to her and urged her to get on antidepressants and overall be a good friend to help. After awhile back at my place she decided to stay at my place for the night, cool, no problem I thought, she could sleep on the couch. But she asked to sleep in bed with me, and this is where I am getting all messed up and confused. So, me being a dumb guy, I let her sleep in bed with me. Nothing happened that night except for some cuddling but I woke up very awkward because she was still my ex and I can tell she was feeling awkward too. This kind of brought up old feelings for her. After that morning she went to a counselor and talked about what to do in our situation and best solution was to do couples counseling. I thought, alright, cool we can maybe fix this relationship but the kicker is that we are going only as friends. Now I dont object being friends with her its just that going to couples counseling to fix our friendship sounds weird. Does anyone else go to couples counseling to be friends with ex? Is she wanting to be with me but too afraid to admit it? And I also guess should I try it out and see what therapist says about situation and go from there?
