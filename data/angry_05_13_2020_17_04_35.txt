I just want to stop being angry for being its already been months but i still think of my former best friend who left me. I feel betrayed, used, and devastated....but a part of me cant help but see how shes doing or think about our time together or how it became like this out of nowhere. Sometimes i see her social media, which is a dumb thing to do i know, and sometimes i am angry. Angry that she can go off being happy after leaving someone hurt calling me a creep for things that made no sense to our mutual friends about having pics of her nothing sexual in nature just photoshoots we done which i always ask for permission and consent and photos of us hanging out having fun in places around the city which she has took herself as well how am i a creep?! She left me hurt and  calls me a creep and obsessed not understanding shes the cause of it and tells me to go seek help...thats the anger of it all as much as my heart cares about her my mind knows that she doesnt care about me anymore all i just feel like i wasted all those years and pissed that she didnt have the respect for our friendship to talk things out just to end it like that for what? The bf she dated at the time that she screwed up in? Many guys treated her nice to get in her pants thats the long and short of it but i was truly there for her when her life was in shambles when she had no one else to talk to or to cheer her up. I am angry that she can go on life being happy without the guilt and conscience of doing this to ppl. I want the universe to punish her so badly as petty as it sounds she doesnt deserve such happiness she doesn’t deserve anything that makes her happy at all one day that will happen but i also need to focus on myself i just have a hard time letting go why care about someone who clearly doesn’t give a crap about me its been months and yet there are days i feel positive then i feel like this i just want some hope that i can move on i want to i dont want to feel such pain anymore
