Hey so I just had my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend (22), I'm 21 f, and he left to go visit his parents a few days after and once this whole COVID19 hit he decided to stay there, as he did not want to return back to his dorm with roomates. Anyways, we spoke throughout the end of March and April and then on Monday of this week he called me and said we needed to break up. He told me "it's not me, it's him", that he can't be commited right now and give me the love I deserve. This was a huge shock as we were planning for him to make a trip to come see me for a bit and he was telling me he loved me and stuff, like 2 days prior. I will admit I kind've noticed he was becoming inscreasingly irritable throughout the month and kept losing his patience with me. He asked for a break, which lasted for 3 days and then for another one later on, which lasted a week but each time he reached out and told me he was sorry and it was his fault. I do think he's going through some kind of depression or battling something and doesn't want to take it out on me. But it hurts so much that we couldn't have just talked about it or he that he could've came over to see me face to face, because it's different over the phone. Throughout our relationship we always worked things out and he was always the one to make the first move when he was ready to apologize or kiss or hug me. I just hope this is temporary, I don't want to move on, I want him back. He said I can still text him, because he will be there for me and he promised to come see me once quarantine is over. But I want him as my bf and still have our relationship, not some random ex to text, because I'm sad. I don't I will text him and just wait for him to reach out to me when he is ready. I really do want to hope that this was just a space this and he'll come back.
