I (M31) had a dorky/hot sales manager (33F) always dressed the part in a button down and skirt cute heels with her hair up in an interesting way. she was a tiny bit flirty every now and then, and there was definitely a sexual tension in the air (which always drove me wild) she’d stand just a tiny bit to close to my desk, (she always smelled a tiny bit like vanilla and flowers) , she’d lean forward to get something from her bag when she wasn’t wearing a bra (she was petite and pretty flat chested so it wasn’t terribly overt) we ended up working way late one night and As we both stood up to leave she kind of step in toward me, so I went for it, grabbed her waist pulled her in and we started making out hard. After about ten second I feel her hand on my cock, figured it was going to get real so I pushed her back against the cube wall got on my knees and started pulling her skirt up. I lifted her leg up over my shoulder, I still remember her hand pulling her little yellow panties to the side, she was already wet, she tried to apologize that she wasn’t clean shaven, I went right in, wanted to make sure she could tell that the landing strip/grooming absolutely wasn’t a problem. I pushed my tongue into her lips and clit and slowly put  my finger inside her to rub her g spot for like ten minutes (but it felt like 30 seconds,) she started pushing against my face and had her hand on the back of my head, she starts breathing shallow and I could tell she was getting there, I reached up and grabbed the tit she’d taken out and as soon as I get my hand on it she started shaking clamps her hand over her mouth I pinched her nipple and pulled a bit while I flicked my tongue on her clit and I feel a warm slightly sweet/salty/ thick gush on my chin. She gave four or five sort of convulsion and pretty much collapsed into her chair, I leaned over her kissed her neck for a few seconds  right behind the ear and whispered I’d see her tomorrow.  Walked out she still had her panties down to her knees. Rode my motorcycle home, smelling her pussy the entire time. She looked me in the eyes for about 3 seconds longer than was appropriate the next morning cracked the tiniest smile and we never really brought it up.
