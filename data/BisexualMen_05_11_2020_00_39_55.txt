I mostly like girls but am sexually attracted to men and women. So I have a friend X who is the same age as me works at a store I frequent and have been going to for years. He is muscular and good looking with a humble reserved personality also funny. The first time we ever met we talked for hours about shared interests in weightlifting and nutrition and such. Lately though we’ve been talking more and more and I can’t help but have my eyes wander towards his hot body and think about how attractive his eyes are. He’s said something before and added “women or guys, whatever you like” and gave a little laugh after. Which I guess is showing he doesn’t care about people’s sexuality. Also last week he was watching a video on my phone and a scruff notification popped up! He kept asking what it was and I just said I don’t know. A few days later he brought me some stuff he wanted me to try. Then a week after the scruff thing he mentioned what was that notification on your phone again. Also sometimes we make eye contact way more intensely than I do with friends and I made a sexual sound as a joke and he stared at me in a way that just looked like attraction to me. I almost felt like I could feel it. Today he was looking at boner pills and commenting on the guys package! He honestly has some gay mannerisms and his hobbies include lifting which is slightly homoerotic at its core. I know he has also had girlfriends before. We’ve talk for hours and hours and I really enjoy I guess the feeling of brotherly love and camaraderie I get from him. I think I want to admit I like dudes to him but don’t want it to hurt our friendship. Also lately I can’t get him off my mind like I keep fantasizing about him and it feels wrong to be doing. I hang out at his job and we have talked for hours before. I know his schedule by heart now and get excited about the thought of him working again.  Does anyone have any advice? Could he possible be a bi guy too?
