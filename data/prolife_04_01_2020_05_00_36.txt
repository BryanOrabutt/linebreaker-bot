Iâ€™ve been browsing the r/abortion a lot and  ive  been  seeing a lot of  emotionally  distraught  women  seeking  help  and  emotional  support  while  they  are  in  these  hard  times.  Most  of  them  are  scared  to  get  an  abortion  and  fear  its  the  wrong  choice  but  of  course  because  they  are  in  an  abortion  echo  chamber  they  often  go  through  with  it  and  i  at  least  3  of  the  posts  i  saw  of  women  who  were  scared  to  get  an  abortion  later  posted  that  they  felt  guilty  and  they  regret  their  decision  to  have  one.  of  course  they  will  ban  any  member  who  dares  suggest  abortion  isnt  the  perfect  option  but  you  can  private  message  these  women  and  send  them  words  of  encouragement,  possibly share  your  personal  experiences  with  abortion  and  how  it  effected  you  and  provide  them  with  links  to  crisis  pregnancy  centers  and  pregnancy hotlines.  we  need  to  be  on  the  front  lines  and  going  to  these  Women  who  arent  confident  in  their  capability of  being  mothers.  Of  course  i  do  not  condone  in  ANY  harassment of  these  women  or  brigading  of  these  women  but  i  do  think  that  they  need  help.  I  ask  everyone  in  here  for  5  minutes  of  your  time  to  go  there  read  these  womens  stories  and  offer  them  encouragement  and  resources.
