So I had a thing with this guy for about 1.5 years. Everything was great we really hit it off. It wasn’t until he told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship because he was still in love with his ex. Still I tried with him but when nothing worked, I would tell him I needed my space. This happened about 3X during the year. He was always very hot and cold with me, sometimes take up to 12 hours to reply or a week! & always talked about his ex. He told me he liked me and was scared to fall in love with me because he wasn’t ready. I did so much for this guy, I was so nice to him!! when he was sick I’d cook for him, for his birthday I made him a gift. But He didn’t even wish me a happy Valentine’s Day (& I had made him chocolate covered strawberries) or a merry Christmas, he didn’t even talk to me on either of those days. Every time i would tell him I needed space, he would contact me and tell me how he didn’t want to lose me because he did like me and I always fell for it, he would always say he just wasn’t ready for anything. I feel like he played me, better yet i know or maybe used me for sex idk. Anyways, long story short, he told me he was moving to a different city, and asked me to have dinner with him before he moved. I said yes but then before he moved I found out he was talking to another girl in that city, so I logged into IG and sure enough it was the same girl I heard about.  the girl had commented on his most recent selfie with 😍 and i was so devastated and he also did the same one one of her pics (which he never did to mine). I immediately blocked him on IG and Snapchat because he would literally give me anxiety. Before he moved he asked me if i still wanted to have dinner? And I told him No, that it’s best we didn’t see each other for now but that I wish him the best in his new journey and I thanked him for the memories. I didn’t mention that I even found out about the other girl (Was I dumb for not going off on him??),  I just felt like it wasn’t my place because he isn’t my bf. Anyway, he replied saying that he understands and that he appreciates meeting me and all the memories as well. I didn’t reply after that, 10 days later he texted me asking how I was doing & how everything was at my new job? & I didn’t reply, i deleted the message but now I feel so guilty for not replying to him, but why should I feel guilty if he treated me like an option. I guess I just feel bad because we said goodbye in a nice way, and he doesn’t know I was upset about the girl & I felt like a bitch because he was just checking up on me. But why do i feel so bad?!!! Am i wrong ?? Or a bad person???? Do i owe him an explanation about that girl, or is it not even worth it?
