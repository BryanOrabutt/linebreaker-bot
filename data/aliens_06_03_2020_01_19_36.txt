>So I don't really know of a good place other then here to post this but this happened when I was about 5 or 6 and I still remember it very clearly and I know it happened for sure and it's really strange. So one night when I was 5 or 6 ish I woke up to my dad Telling me that we have to see something, It was late like 5 am late and I even thought it was weird he would wake me up soo early to see "something". He took me outside and the ground was wet so i thought it was raining earlier and at the time it was just me and him in a 2 bedroom small house in a small private neighborhood a few miles out side of a town of 800k it was quiet and nice and it was a square shape neighborhood 4 blocks in total one road in and out. Anyways We walked down the road and up the main road and what i seen will change me forever the first house on the main road where a old guy 70 ish years old lived and he had a large oak tree in his back yard and the top of the tree was gone it looked like lighting struck it and where the rest of the tree use to be there was a large bright blue ball it was so bright I couldn't look straight into it and it was large the old guy's house was a single floor, 2 bedroom  full home but like a cabin and it was as big as his house and his back yard but the other thing was the whole neighborhood was there staring at it and there was this deep buzzing that was loud and few people were humming along with it they were all family's i knew and from the adults to other kids my age were looking at it they seemed paralyzed there and after what felt like 30 minutes of us just standing there I walked in front of them and tapped on their backs and nothing even my own dad was there paralyzed other then me I tried to scream but I couldn't even hear myself scream so I just walked home and went back to sleep , I didn't know what was happening but did think much of it at the time. The next day I woke up to chainsaw's and I opened my eyes and there was a hole in the ceiling, later that day I learned that a tree was hit by lighting and the biggest branch fell right above me right between my eyes and the reason It stayed with me is because I would have nightmares of it and the people would be looking at me dead in the eyes but their eyes were the weird blue ball thing their faces slowly turned black and so did their bodies. They lasted for about 3 years and are still with me like it just happened. I have no clue of what it was or what happened it still haunts me..... sorry its so long.
