so i was skateboarding like i always do when i get bored. i was skating down my main strip to where i live at like 3:00 am because i was bored and couldn't sleep and theirs usually no one up,so this seemed kind of odd when there were cars all around me. i pull off to the side of the street to change my song and it didn't seem weird to see cop cars stopping, and asking if i was ok, but it seemed kind of off when i looked up at the officer he looked like a normal officer that i usually talk to since i get stopped a lot, and it wasn't out of the ordinary. so put "shot down by abstract" on and i started riding again and i turn down one of the roads i usually ride on, but it seemed kind of off the busy street i was just on just went quiet as i rode down the road and i thought nothing of it until i turn back onto the main strip i look both ways and all the stop lights are red and it didn't seem weird because it happened all the time but there where no cars coming on either lane or on the roads so i stand there for a few moments and watch time pass. it passes like 7 minutes and still nothing so i start back off riding to my house, cause i thought i might had been dreaming somewhat as im riding, im looking around and one of the main roads are now just dirt and rocks, so i got confused and didn't pay attention to my surroundings and i hit a patch of rocks and go flying off my board. i hit the ground and start rolling, but as i stand up the road that was dirt and stones is back to concrete and the stop lights are green, so at this point im confused and i go to ride down one of these hills i like to ride its a long hill with a good bit of ups and downs, like it has enough to keep me gaining speed but not enough for my board to get over well-med and start to shake as im walking this road up to the hit before i go to my house the sides of the roads and its just covered in lush forest, which isn't like normal since there is usually a small grass field before the forest hits,and i ride down the hill as fast as i can. i pull up to the stop sign and turn left onto my road as i skate down it just a random car comes out of no where behind me, like there were no cars coming when i turned, i heard no engine behind me, i saw no lights and bam a car i pull left and let them pass,i stop skating and walk to my house. the next day i go to ride the hill and the forest is back to normal and the stop lights are not acting up again and i still have no clue what happened to this day.
