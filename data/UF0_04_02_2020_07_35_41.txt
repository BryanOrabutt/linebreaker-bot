Hey everyone, this is my first post on the sub but I wanted to share what I saw a couple years ago in Des Moines. One night sometime during the first half of 2017 my friends and I were driving down the road in Iowa, not a rural area but a populated city in Des Moines. As we were pulling up to the stoplight we saw what looked like a plane flying in our direction but as we got closer the perspective changed and we realized it was a lot closer to us and the ground than we had thought. It also wasn’t moving at all. As we tried to comprehend what was going on we thought it might be a drone, but this thing didn’t make a sound. It was just hovering above the trees completely silent. It was hard to make out the shape because it was night but it had white lights all around it with what looked like a couple green ones too. We just sat there looking at it. The stoplight turned green but we didn’t care, nobody else was on the road so we were the only ones witnessing this. Suddenly it did a type of u-turn but the way it did was it swooped quickly and snapped in the other direction almost like a 180 without barely moving the vehicle. We continued driving home, hoping we could catch it above the trees we drove past. We didn’t see anything but when we ended up at my house which is about 10 minutes in the direction the object flew from where we saw it, I started to get out of my friend’s car and at the end of my street, we all saw the object zoom by at an insane speed! We all freaked out and drove towards where we saw it as fast as we could but after circling the outside of my neighborhood it was nowhere to be seen. When this happened we all just thought it was strange and shrugged it off cuz there must’ve been some explanation. But now after hearing other ufo encounters and all these things going on with the military I’ve made connections between my experience and others’ and it’s just too hard to deny the similarities so I’m convinced it wasn’t just a drone we saw this night.
