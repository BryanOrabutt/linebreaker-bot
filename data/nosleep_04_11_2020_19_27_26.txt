Well okay let me start by saying when i was younger my parents moved too a house out in the country. A nice little mini mansion my father called it let me give you the lay out. When you first entered the front door there were stairs to the right the living room to the left and the kitchen in the front the kitchen was pretty big with a door that led to a pantry which my parents turned into the downstairs bedroom and up stairs were four bedrooms 2 on the left one on the right and at the end of the hallway that one at the end of the hall was mine i had 3 other siblings so they slept in their own rooms now on the first night before we had everything moved and set up i decided too look out my window and i saw a dog like figure i thought it was my dog until i looked up onto my bed and he was laying there like the lazy puppy he is so anyways after getting settled in a few nights later i heard people outside in our woods my window was wide open i heard one of them say go run and another voice say what the hell is that thing that is when i got worried and remembered the dog like creature i saw run below my window just a few days earlier i needed too go outside and help but my parents would find out so i stayed and listened silence nothing i absolutely would not sleep that night even though it was a school night i told my dad about what happened he shrugged it off as my wild imagination alot of paranormal stuff happened including doors opening by them selves the radio turning on exactly at midnight and finally the basement oh god the basement we would hear noises coming from down their were almost demonic and one night when i thought it absolutely couldn't get any worse a black figure came creeping from the closest just like any child hood nightmare now i was 13 at the time it walked up to my bed and stood their staring i was horrified i couldn't scream couldn't move couldn't do a single damn thing the very next night it was just me and my dog as my parents and siblings went out for ice cream it was around 6:00 pm when they left i thought they would be back in just half an hour boy was i wrong i decided too stay downstairs i would NOT go upstairs by myself even with my dog i think he was just about freaked out as i was for those wondering what breed he was a lab/pit bull mix  a great swimmer and just all out funny but when we were alone he stayed so close too me as too even hide in the bathtub when i went too use the bathroom so soon it is 11:00 i call them cause i am worried no answer that is when i hear footsteps upstairs my dog is practically sitting on my lap now 11:30 singing the radio is off the kitchen light goes out the light on the stairs goes out the only light is the TV and the living room lamp and the laundry room light 11:40 the laundry room light goes out i'm texting my friends no answer  the second it strikes twelve the radio turns on by itself the only light is the TV i get up and turn the radio off and the lamp back on 12:55 my parents walk through the door i have never been happier too see them in my life almost a week later the same thing happens to my parents except the gun cabinet downstairs  opens by it self now it has a lock on it the can only be open by pulling a tight latch open and this thing opens by it self no wind could've opened it i mean the thing has an iron latch that has to be pulled out of a steel ring i came downstairs at the right moment to notice it open by it self my parents believe me now that this place is haunted so we move out a few months later it has been a few years but that thing is back i see it outside even during the day and it screws with the front door i see it but it refuses too come in i have confronted it before every night it teases me while waiting out side the front door i have no idea what it is where it came from if the thing was summoned i have no idea even if this thing is part of my imagination or a part of my child hood home i do know one thing for sure it toys with me every night even during storms there was only one time it didn't bother me on Christmas eve when there was a snow storm it is getting worse and worse one day i decided to sleep in a different part of the house and i woke up too tapping on the window it i refused to open the blinds i ran out and slept on the living room floor what is this thing what is it if you guy's have any knowledge at all on anything black slender thing that looks slightly human please tell me and if you have any idea of getting rid of it oh i think i forgot too mention once i had my friend over too back and explore we found some old run down barns with a blow up mattress and a can of spray paint stupidly my friend shot it and got spray paint in his eyes we raced back to our house and washed it out of his face and eyes i went back there a few times by myself but if you have any knowledge on or of this thing at all this is my plea for help this is all true and none of it made up i swear!!!
