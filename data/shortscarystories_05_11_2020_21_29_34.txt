I'm Writing This Because It's Strange. I Live Alone In The Rural State, Vermont. Most Places Aren't Crowded, Or Have All Those Fancy Shops/Resturants. We Actually Have The Boring Dollar Tree And Not Well-Known Grocery Stores That Most Big Cities Have. Right Now, It's Pouring Which Is Perfect To Write This. It's Perfect For A Scary Vibe When Writing. Enough Rambling, So, As I Said, I Live Alone. I'm Young, Only 19 Years Old. I'm Always Home Now Because Of This Covid-19 Pandemic Which, I'm Slowly Going Insane. I Only Have My Black Cat For Company. Often My Cat, She Looks Over Above Me Or To The Side Of Me For A Few Minutes. She Meows Every Early Morning At My Door Until The Third Time I Call To Her "Abby, Stop It. You're Fine." She Eventually Stops After A Few More Meows. Recently, Throughout The Day, Once Each Day, Any Random Room I Walk In To At Any Time, I Look Down And See, Weird, Pieces Of Random Stuff. It Could Be A Wood Chips, A Small Nail, Anything. I Pick Them Up And Think To Myself 'What? Uh' Something Along The Lines To That. I Even Hear, Voices, It's Not The TV. It Sounds Like A Conversation But, When I Do, That's Especially When I Find Pieces Of Different Things. Pieces Of What You Would Find In A Shed. I Don't Use My Shed Much, Actually Not At All. So I Don't Get How, Those, Those Pieces Could Be In My House. My Cat Is An Indoor Cat. That's Not All Though. There's Few More, Like Every Single Night, I Have Nightmares. Each Day I Hear Random Bangs/Vibrations At Any Time For Only, A Few Minutes. Maybe It Is Me But I Know It's Not. I Am Not Sure As To Why Random Pieces That Weren't In My House The Night Before, Suddenly The Next Morning Appeared. I Think There's Something Or Someone Watching Me. But With The Type Of Pieces, It Would Have To Be Someone Who Uses Things In My Shed. Maybe Someone's Living In My Shed. I'm Not Sure. Maybe This Isolation Is Really Driving Me Insane. I Don't Know. That's All I Guess, For Now That Is. Oh, One More Thing, Is I Randomly Bleed From Spots On My Body That Aren't Injured. I Know Strange, Bye I Guess...
