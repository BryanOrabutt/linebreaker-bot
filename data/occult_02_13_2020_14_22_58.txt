 There was a haunted courtroom In Michigan, we were all there in the winter storm and rain and lightning having a city meeting or something, while we were talking we heard a ghostly deep gravely voice, next thing I know we’re outside in this haunted hell forest, looking for this thing, we walked down a hill to this pile of old trees, it was purple and black and has a couple red glowing lights in it. This demon emerged and We had to Run, uphill, and we couldn’t stop or it would catch us, we were always running up hill past these weird historical sites and wherever you ran out of energy and stopped that’s the spirit that would kill you or whatever. Like on top of this rocky hilly vividly colored amber pink sky there was a giant bare breasted woman being dragged (I think maybe the bare breasted woman seen in French Revolution paintings) if you stopped there you would be dragged and beheaded by a guillotine. There was Israel where Jesus carried his cross and was crucified, and there was a Roman soldier in blood stained rusty centurion armor,if you stopped here the romans would nail you to the cross as Jesus was.. I kept running and came to this big altar in a beautiful green prairie (Maybe Stonehenge?) and if you stopped here a giant pale skinned man would grab you by the head and slam you on the altar shattering your bones and killing you.. This is where the person I was with couldn’t run anymore so he stopped, I kept going and now was in a Japanese setting.. The cherry blossom 🌸 trees and old wooden buildings in the misty mountains, there was a samurai on his knees getting ready to be executed, if I stopped here I’d be killed the same as him.. I came to the cost, on a cliff of a big huge ocean, I seen whales and whales and dolphins 🐋 just splashing and swimming around🐬,  it’s where I stopped then I woke up. The colors of the dream where so vivid and beautiful, like, if you look at the summer sky when there’s orange/pink/blue/purple as the sun sets.. Thomas was the color of the sky in this dimension, and it reflected down making the grass and trees have this same color but just faintly where you could still see the green of the grass and trees..
