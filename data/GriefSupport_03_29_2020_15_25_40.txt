Hello everyone! I'm going through a hard time and hoping to find some understanding people here. I've lost my sweet cat on the 1st of march  and I've lost my grandma on the 3rd or march...  Little story. I've grown up with my grandma, she was like a 3rd parent to me & also my only grandparent. So she was so so so close to me. There were some things only she could understand. She supported me without judgement which I found pretty rare in this world. Don't get me wrong luckily I have unconditional support from my parents too, but they can be critical too. My grandma wasn't like that, she acceped every crazy ideas I had, supported me in my art as I have low self-esteem. Also I'm a pretty sensitive person so one critical word can hurt me badly. That's why my grandma was so special to me, to have a person like her in my life. She started to have Alzheimer in October and in December my family couldn't cope with her it anymore. So we had to call the ambulance on her and I was the one who went with her to the hospital... Then I saw her getting more and more ill. Now, I have 2 cats who mean the world to me. I don't want children and I'm aromantic (can't have romantic feelings), so my pets mean the world to me. Mici is (was) 9 years old and Snowy is 13. Snowy became sick when my grandma got into hospital. I was horrified she'll leave me too. Then suddenly my neighbour killed my cat Mici, she hit him by car. It was an accident she said, but I'm not sure... they're those neighbourhs whom are hated by everyone. The docs tried everything, but his little body gave up. Two days later my grandma died too. I've been struggling from anxiety as long as I can remember, I've decided to finally go to a doc, but then the virus came. I'm now here in lockdown with my sick sweetie Snowy, struggling from anxiety & depression, trying to do the best in uni and what I really need is some people who really can understand my pain. Thank you everyone who reads my story. Stay safe! <3
