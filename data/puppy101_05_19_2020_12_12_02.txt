Hey everyone! My boyfriend and I got a newfie from a reputable breeder a month or so ago. He was a dream to train! Potty trained within a week, and knows sit, shake, other paw (to shake with his other paw), stay, and lay down. When we were first starting to train him, we would reward him everytime he did it for the first day, then we slowly started taking the treat rewards away so he didn't completely associate it with a reward everytime he did it. We just randomly give him the reward now. The past week, he has really been testing my patience with his stubborn and defiant behavior. I make him sit and stay before I open the door for him to go to the back yard, because he likes to bulldoze in and out of the door often times tripping whoever is walking in or out. Lately, he hasn't been wanting to sit at the door when told and will just stand there looking down at the ground, and we stand there until he decides he is going to sit and stay (I'm just as stubborn). He only wants to do the commands when he deems it necessary, which I obviously want to break him of immediately. We don't really punish him in the sense of physical punishment, we just firmly tell him no and ignore him after that until he chills out. Today, he decided he was going to chew up my boyfriends shoes, which he has never done. We have plenty of toys for him to chew on, as well as give him some kind of chew treat at least once every couple days, depending on what treat it is we give him. A bullystick lasts up to 2 days for him, but other chews don't last nearly as long. I know this breed is super smart, but also just as stubborn. He gets more than enough exercise for his breed, and he has anything he could possibly want, including a pool as the breed is known for water rescues and love water. Any tips for me on how to handle the defiant behavior? I know it's just a part of him being a puppy, but I don't want him to get used to defying us and think it's okay to do.
