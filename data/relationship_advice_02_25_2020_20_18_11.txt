I and L hung out together pretty often. We went to each others' houses and his parents were very hospitable towards me. We were practically best friends and it was the most precious friendship I had formed in a really long while, following the fall-out with my group of friends a year prior. I was really happy but I guess there really is no 100% friendship between a girl and  a boy especially when they get really close. I developed feelings for him but did not tell him anything and just watched out for cues. We were in the car together last week (it was parked in a pretty quiet area and it was late). we were playing music and jamming then L said lets sit together in the backseat so we can talk (he really did mean talk and there wasnt even a hint of something off). We went back and for the next 30-45 minutes we talked about everything and anything that came to our minds. I felt this might have been the best time to confess my feelings so I leaned a little bit on him and said, "how fast can this car race because my heart is racing much faster". I know its 'cringy' but I'm 17 and he is the first guy I ever really liked. L leaned in and started kissing me and said that his 'won the race' , please bear with me I know it's really cringy to hear. Anyway I really liked the kiss but he wanted to go even further and started taking off my clothes so i told him maybe not today because i am seriously not ready and he was like "I'll make you ready"and did his thing. After he was done, he cleaned the area, dressed me back and hugged me and he was just SO NICE to me that I know, stupid, i forgot what he just did. While driving me back home he was full of sweet talk and i just really want to get over this incident and be with him. But here i am, a week later, still feel like something that wasnt supposed to happen had taken place. I dont think he meant it this way and it's not in his personality at all to do things by force. What should I do to deal with this ?
