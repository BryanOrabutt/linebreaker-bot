Okay, here it goes, after dating for about two years we get married, have two children, stress begins to build, I'm at work, she's at home, I'll skip the in-between and problems part, same things you have probably heard from every relationship, she may have thought I was going to leave her so she made the first move and took the kids, tried to get a restraining order on me, and I filed for divorce , now two years has passed, we've been in communication almost every day due to the children, I still love her and attracted to her very much, but I just found out that she has been seeing my cousin for months now, I can tell she's not taking that too seriously and may have just done it as a revenge or to just get attention from him, be taken out, thinking of them being intimate is devastating for me, when I see her I still can tell she has strong emotions towards me, whether it be hate or something else, we spent two days together total in the last two years and with the children, they were extremely enjoyable days, she agreed, but try to make it seem like I was pretending, didn't make sense to me, and Ayesha even teared up about how amazing the day was, but it felt like all the other Sundays we had spent together, things would usually be fine when we were together, it's when I was at work or she would have to wait for me or would have to be doing stressful things that would trigger her, but when it was mostly recreational she would be very happy. I want to be a family again with the children and have her back, I have been studying about BPD for 2 years, she refuses to try the medications that have been recommended, and she will not directly admit to having the symptoms, one time she did mention PTSD, so that's a start, my question is how do I get her back, she has set boundaries that she wants me to follow, I don't know if she's expecting me to break them or what, I think she had also convinced herself that I'm a narcissist, and was trying to do the no contact thing, I'm not sure if she's over that or not yet but still is basically acting the same way, what should I do?
