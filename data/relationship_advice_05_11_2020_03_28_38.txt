So.... this might be somewhat heavy for some people so I just wanna add a trigger warning cuz this includes some assult so... heres what happned this happned a about 5 days ago(I'm 16 btw) I have already moved out and live with my bf's parents (hes also 16 I moved there cuz the teachers at the school in my home town were buttholes to me)  but we only live 40 minutes away tho so I visit every weekend I have 4 friends here wich I hang out with almost every weekend I only hangout with my guy friend at night however we use to be f**k buddies and we stopped when I got a boyfriend we had agreed to not do anything sexual and that was that I went to go hangout with him while his parents were asleep we went to his room and just chilled talked and vaped in his bed when he pulls me in and starts hugging me so I just hug him back and we start cuddling I was wearing baggy pants so he thought it would be funny to see if they fit him I reluctantly agreed and took of my pants he tried them on then threw then where my jacked was I was just finding anything to talk about and sense we are good friends I talked about bras and tops my top was uncomfortable so I decided to take it off without revealing anything ofc I just did it under my shirt we continued cuddling and chatting when he started groping me and i didnt say anything he suddenly took his pants and shirt off and soon after his underwear we continued cuddling and then he lifted my shirt up for some reason to look and play with my chest idk I took it as a weird joke or something and chuckled and pulled my shirt back down (btw he had been complimenting me being super nice to me now I feel like he was just trying to manipulate me) (I'm pretty easily manipulated) he suddenly looked at my face and took my head and kissed me I didnt wanna make him mad so i....kissed him back..... soon after we continued cuddling me on top of him he started rubbing his genitalia against mine I was wearing underwear ofc soon after like 10 seconds I got off him and tried to start chatting to him again(he was going to do something out of town soon so we couldn't hang out for a while) he then said "cmon we cant hang out for a while why not make do something sense we cant hang out for a while. I stayed silent and just shrugged and said idk he then TOOK MY HAND and put it ON HIS GENITALIA and said "cmon" i just took my hand away he then pulled me on top of him and continued rubbing his genatalia up against me then took my head and started kissing me I kinda just wanted it to be over and I wanted to leave it continued for about 3 minutes then I gott off him we talked about other stuff for like 2 minutes and then I said I should probobly leave so I did and then went outside up to the school sat on the swings and cried I then walked home and went to my boyfriend I was pretty much completely silent we just went to bed I told him I loved him and he said he loved me back and then we went to sleep I feel like this is my fault and I feel really guilty and I dont know what the heck to do ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
