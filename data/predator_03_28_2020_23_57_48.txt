Playing the demo i notice allot of things that are bad its fun to play with friends and had no problem with the game itself no bugs it took me about 3 min to find a match each time so no complaints there. The one thing all console players most likely notice is the graphics look like there coming from a game cube in other words not very good or up to date that is no problem when you just work around it but it has effected my vision on looking through tree tops with everything looking like almost a blur its very hard to get a clear view on the predator. The next thing is the AI game play i am not a fan of wasting my time on bots in an online game where its suppose to be a pvp my first game on all i did was kill AI the predator was either afk or confuse at where my team was at the other few games i played the predator almost made no appearance making majority of the game just killing AI and doing the objective i got board of the game after 3 matches i would rather let the predator kill me then have to keep going through AI just to get to the end of the match. The last thing is i did not know i was buying friday the 13 in predator form i wish there was more game modes to explore a campaign not another friday where your only choice is either kill or escape in one mode where nothing ever changes its gets very boring real fast and i played friday like twice a week when i did play it now i know hunting grounds is gonna be the same way its just wasted money im not gonna play the game at all into they release more modes especially if i have to kill AI for 8 to 10 min every game i would rather go play a campaign game where the AI are suppose to be the main objective and it changes objectives and areas and people you meet then replaying the same map with same AI with the same objective just to finally fight the predator who might or might not kill you in 6 sec when he rushes you using his melee weapon. Very board very fast i rate the demo 1 out 5 stars i love predator but that's not gonna change the fact the game is a complete mess and lacks creativity out of all the movies and past games made for predator they had a big stepping stool to put out an awesome game with multiple modes and maps with awesome game play but we got a one game mode like friday where is the experience and fun in the game why dose it feel like a chore every game i don't want to keep killing AI to complete the objective i want an intense match of hiding and fighting the predator that's what i thought the game was gonna be not this.
