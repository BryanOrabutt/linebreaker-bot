I’m scared. I live my life in total dread and fear of trying anything real. I’ve quit Opiates, benzos, I’m at a couple months without weed but for the life of me I can’t put down vapes. I try all the mental motivation tricks but for the life of me I just can’t gather the momentum necessary to break the addiction. What such a pain in the ass to is it such a silent addiction. It isn’t ruining my wife the way that pills ruined parts of my life it’s just a bad habit that’s addictive. You can buy nicotine at any gas station, it’s socially acceptable, The Vape‘s are everywhere at work. I’m not trying to make excuses and just blame the environment but for some reason I just can’t seem to get on a roll with it. I’ve read the Alan Carr book that everybody recommends. Don’t get me wrong it’s a great book as far as putting you in a positive mindset to not smoke any cigarettes but like most self-help books it’s redundant and has a bunch of logical fallacies. Something happens where I start feeling a little bit of withdrawal and I just get way too miserable. It’s an annoying misery that I just can’t seem to nick (ha). It really makes me wonder how connected to myself I actually am it’s not near as miserable as the horrors of benzo withdrawal or driving four hours to the middle of nowhere to go get heroin or something. But it’s like the second that I quit using those hard drugs I put up a defense mechanism at a wall to never go back. Just the thought of using hard drugs again makes me want to kill myself and I’m just not to that point with nicotine. I’m scared to be fully conscious I’m scared to try anything and quitting nicotine just needs more time with myself to break the homeostasis of misery that I live with. It’s my antidepressant. I just keep coming up with all the typical drug addiction excuses. It’s annoying me because I was able to break this cycle with every other fucking drug but I cannot for the life of me gain any moment and it’s driving me nuts
