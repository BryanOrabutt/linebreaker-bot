Hi my name is Thalia I apologize in advance because this is a very long story and is in fact true,I’ll give you a little background about his life my grandpa became the mafia boss at 17 through his father who was the last boss and a few years later he had took a liking to my grandma at 14 years old when he was 24 he than kidnapped my grandma and beat her horribly than once she found out he was in mafia she tried to leave and he burned all her family’s houses down from there on my grandpa killed many people and buried them in the backyard i don’t know why he did it or how he did it but after a few years he built a bigger house over the backyard things started happening very scary things, my grandma would say whenever something happened she’ll get out her bible and pray which only angered the spirits but much more years later my grandpa the age of 79 died by falling down the stairs which we later found out that there were five peoples hand prints on his back we were all creeped out but we ignored it a few years later I was about 8 and my 15 years old cousin were sitting on the bed watching a movie at 9:00pm and all my family members where downstairs when we heard rustling under the bed we than frozed and stared at each other for what felt forever in a 8 year olds mind she than slowly moved away from the edge of the bed and pulled her legs up  but that’s when something dark reached out and pulled her under she was screaming and I couldn’t do anything but cry and my family ran upstairs to see what happened and my cousin was crawling out from under the bed crying her eyes out and ran out the room everyone ran down stairs to see what she was crying for and I was left on the bed crying I stopped when I heard a knock on the closet door I just stared at the door when it swung open and I screamed and ran out many more things happened to me at they’re house thank you for listening I will tell u more later
