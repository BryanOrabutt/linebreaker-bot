Now go easy on me this is my first theory ever okay here it goes Afton was not bad until he lost his son now there may be a hole about what the fredbear plush says don't go you remember what you saw what I think he means is that he saw William helping someone into a suit so this actually lines up with what Scott said what is seen in the shadows is easily misunderstood in the mind of a child so Michael may have thought that his dad was stuffing someone inside when he really was just helping him eventually the bite of 83 occurs and freddy fazbears is shut Down some of you don't think it's freddy fazbears but it is as matpat clarifyed that in his theory and that would mean that was the earliest location also the nightmares in fnaf 4 are not the withered from fnaf 2 they are springlock suits because they have five fingers clearly meaning in non nightmare form they were meant for people to get inside so that means there were 2 freddy fazbear locations before fnaf 2 meaning after the first location closing down William made a promise to put his son back together as an Android and when he saw that it worked he also wanted to become immortal but remnant could be destroyed by fire but William did not care he just wanted his son back which drove him mad so he created the circus animatronics like baby ballora Fun time freddy and Fun time foxy but the place is closed the first day because Elizabeth dies and he sees that Elizabeth's soul is in there because her eyes turned from blue to green this drove William into madness and that might be what the next game fnaf into madness is about so when William finds out about Elizabeth he opens circus baby entertainment and rental to capture more children to experiment with remnant eventually bringing him back to the place he started killing the fnaf 1 location when he destroyed the vessels the spirits were in to take there remnant he never thought they may want revenge so he puts himself in the spring bonnie costume when the springlocks snapped he survived because of the remnant he experimented with eventually he gets out and he goes to fazbears fright whee he survives the fire but he lost an arm then in fnaf 6 he came back but this time he could not escape so his remnant is destroyed and so is Afton
