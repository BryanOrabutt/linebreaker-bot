I’m so useless, arrogant. A spoiled little fucking brat that doesn’t deserve any good in its life. I just hurt people, lie to them, disappoint them, make them uncomfortable. They all hate me and if they don’t do now they will, sooner than later. I hate myself because I shut down whenever I have a workload, like what the fuck? You’ve got shit to do and it looks like I don’t care and I just WANT to disappoint everyone. I say weird shit, I have cero compromise, I’m just a privileged cunt that deserves to die, to suffer, to be punished. I remember a time when this thoughts would never stop roaming around my head and drowned as I walked but now, now, my brain has been mushed. There’s nothing left of it, every thought is gone, every sense of guilt is gone I cry but I don’t feel it. I don’t f e e l things. I’m a freak and a weirdo, fat and ugly, overall disgusting. I don’t deserve success, I shouldn’t have done everything, I shouldn’t have gone to far, now look at me, pathetic as always. I’m useless. I’m useless and an idiot.
