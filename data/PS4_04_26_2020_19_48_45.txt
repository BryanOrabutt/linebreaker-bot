I had fraudulent charges on my Ps4 and I tried to contact PlayStation support about it but it just led me to their “knowledge center”. I had no other choice than to reverse the charge with my bank, but that’s when PlayStation finally noticed me, and they suspended my account, so I went to their website to try to get it all worked out and I found something on their website that told me to click on it so that I can fix it and it took me to the “pre-chat” tab where it said all of the problems and I chose Account Help and then Suspended Account and it brought me right back to their “knowledge center”, so I eventually got into the support chat with a live agent, but it said that the support chat is disabled and it didn’t say when it was going to be back up and it told me to go to their “ever growing knowledge center” which put me right back at square one. So naturally I went straight to their phone number (which is posted on virtually every Ps4 help website) and I was on the phone for about 10 seconds when an automated voice told me that PlayStation’s phone support system was disabled because there aren’t a lot of agents and there is high traffic, which would be fine if I just got a very long wait time but then eventually talked to someone, but instead they just directed me to the “knowledge center” which is not helpful in the slightest. The reason that its “knowledge center” is not helpful AT ALL is because some issues require that we talk or chat to someone because we obviously don’t have clearance to fix the reversal charge or refund something, and when ALL forms of communication with Ps4 is down, and Sony won’t let me talk to them about PlayStation, it feels like I’m being ignored, and I can no longer access my PlayStation (because most of my games are digitally bought) and I can’t play with friends, which is infinitely worse now that there isn’t anything to do. If someone can help, or if PlayStation can get someone to help me with this that would be SO good, because I’m very bored and frustrated.
