I was working at a cafe, only 19, and when I had been there about 6 months this guy walked in to apply. I immediately noticed him and thought he was attractive but he worked night shifts. I later learned he was only 17 and I had never liked a younger guy before so I left it alone for nearly a month. Eventually we worked a shift together when I stayed overtime for a double and began to chat. I could tell he liked me too but his age made me cautious I didn’t want to get played. He eventually made the first move when I caught him in the parking lot of a Walmart after a shift coincidentally. We kissed and I was ecstatic about it for the whole week. I eventually did end up kicking it with him and after a long makeout session with a lot of grinding- he told me to get on top of him. He tugged off my clothes and we started grinding naked. It was driving me absolutely wild that this guy I had been fantasizing about for so long was finally under me. And I could feel every inch of him against my pussy. I would lean back to look at him, his dimples showing while he told me how fine I was. He gently groped at my breasts and then reached down with one hand to slide himself in. Raw. I tried to settle on it slowly but it had been a few months since I last fucked anyone and I do kegels often. He was thick and I only made it half way with a gasp before he impatiently grabbed my hips and pulled me down on him. I bit my lip, watching his face twist with pleasure. I was so turned on I thought I would actually cum which usually doesn’t happen when I don’t get eaten out or use a toy. I was rubbing my clit and riding him, for only about 3-4 strokes when I felt him pull me off. I blinked- surprised. He said “that was close” and I realized he’d cum. It took me a second to come to my senses and slip off him, still very turned on. I figured he probably didn’t have another round in him and gave him a towel. Then I took him home
