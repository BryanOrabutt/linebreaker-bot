Hi I'm a 15 year old and my mom has been abusive basically my whole life.  The earliest I remember is when I was 6 years old wherein I looked at her whilst I was drinking a Can of Coke then she told me to leave the house. I dont remember why she said that but her behaviour towards me has gotten way worse ever since. 9 years ago I told my Aunts my situation , one of my uncles eavesdropped on me and my aunt and told my mom what happened so long story short,  the situation got worse. She was verbally abusive until then,  but ever since my uncle told her what I told my Aunts, she has become physically abusive too. It has gotten to a point where I almost punched her back in 2016. Anw as the years past, she has gotten way more abusive,  and because of that,  I started to have Suicidal thoughts. Earlier this year, I approached the Social Welfare department in my city and the guidance counselor in my school and I told them about my situation. So they arranged a conferencr with my parents, I was hoping it'll make things better but it didn't,  in fact it got way worse. My mom didn't attend saying that she had "work" but I know thats just an excuse for her not to attend,  so my dad attended instead. Anw my dad told my mom what was talked about in the conference and like I said earlier,  things got way worse. She didn't give me allowance for school for a week ,  and she has been verbally attacking me more than ever,  ever since the conference and it has gotten to a point where I didn't eat food for a day just so I could avoid her,  every time we eat she attacks me. My dad keeps on protecting her saying that "I have it good" and that I'm lucky,and that i should just ignore her,  he even told me that I was selfish in reporting her saying that I want to break the family apart.  Its now the 7th week of Quarantine at our place,  and I don't know what to do anymore. Should I report her again,  or should I just suck it?
