I hadn’t talked to my ex in a few months so I decided to check in on her during quarantine. She’s a great person and I respect her a lot. I said hey how’s it going I hope you’re doing well and I told her my dad was diagnosed with cancer and if she heard anything about that, he’s gonna be okay and not to worry about it.(she might of thought that was to get her to pity me) After about a day of no reply I suddenly got an angry paragraph saying things like she wish she dumped me earlier and the real reason she broke up with me is because i mentally, verbally and sexually abused her, and i’m a reminder of what she hates. I would like anyone who reads this to know I would never try to abuse someone or hurt them in any sort of way. I loved my ex and cared for her and I still do. I was extremely depressed and in a horrible mental state when I was dating her and remember I used her a clutch to make me happy and she was always there for me but maybe she took that as me using her to get what I want. Sometimes I would really open up to her and tell her I felt like killing myself and she’d say why don’t you come to my house, and we’d do typical couple things and talk and have fun so I never even realized or thought that I was possibly hurting her in some way. I feel extremely bad, I had no idea I hurt and scared her that much and she doesn’t want me to reach out to her. I told her I was sorry, I don’t expect to be forgiven and I didn’t mean in any sort to abuse her or upset her. For the past few hours i’ve felt like shit, i’m scared, and I don’t know how it make it up or if I can and I don’t know how to live with the fact that I hurt and abused someone I loved and cared for. I had no idea it seemed as if I abused her and I just don’t know what to. Any suggestions or good advice?
