so me and my girlfriend broke up. i dated her ldr for a year and we were pretty close. i’m pretty sure i was her first love and after awhile my feelings went away for her so i ended it. she also wasn’t mentally good for a relationship as she was going through a lot and for half a year i tried helping her but soon i couldn’t mentally handle it myself. the relationship was doing more harm than good for me so i ended it. she begged for me back and i kept on saying no. she blocked me then unblocked me and kept on asking for a second chance. after a week she asked to just be friends and since i’m going to be going to college that’s 15 minutes away from her i said sure(she has my hoodies and i want them back). so we were logged into each other’s instagrams and when we broke up i tried logging out of hers but instagram wouldn’t let me. i logged out and then it still showed up on my accounts and after a couple times of trying to remove it i was like whatever it’s not letting me. she rarely uses her instagram anyways so i thought it’d be fine. i’m kinda glad i didn’t now. before her i dated this girl and she was my first love. her name’s sariah. me and sariah went through a lot and we ended on bad terms. sariah saw me happy with my now ex and she wanted to get back with me so she texted my then current girlfriend and said i cheated but she had no proof. she made up a story and my then girlfriend believed her and then i defended myself and she ended up believing me in the end. now since we broke up i got a notification from her account and she’s texting my ex asking for the real information because i “manipulated her” into believing my story. since she’s 15 minutes away from my college i’m afraid that she’ll come and try to find me and make a huge scene. i don’t know what i can do to get her to leave me alone. she’s a super immature person and that’s another reason why i ended things
