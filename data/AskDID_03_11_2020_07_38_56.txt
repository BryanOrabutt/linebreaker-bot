So I made a post recently about how I didn't know if the memories of potential trauma that are creeping up in my mind are real or if I'm making it up and how I'm missing a huge chunk of my childhood except from a few very sharp memories. I started doing my research out of curiosity but that's just it. This morning I woke up to find one of the really big plushies that I keep at the other end of room in my bed. Like I cant tell I'm 100% sure but at least 90% sure that it wasn't their yesterday as far as i cant remember and i never sleep with it usually. It's just decorative. I remember making a call around 11pm and then I had to work really hard to remember that I just went to bed listening to some youtube videos. I checked my youtube history and the last watched video is the last I remember putting on. When i woke up there was also google asking me if i wanted to reopen a website called pillowfort something that I have absolutely no memories of but it doesn't show up in my google history so ??? I don't think I remember falling asleep, usually I remember pretty accurately closing my eyes and not paying attention anymore and I can go back to the last video on my youtube history the next day. But I remember very sharply the last minute of the last video on my history and I am quite certain that I was listening to this chunk while brushing my teeth. I think I kinda remember going back to my room and getting into pajamas but then nothing. I don't think it ever happened to me. I always remember going to bed and listening to videos and all but not today. It's just sooo weird lol. I tried to remember if my parents could have moved the plushie but my mom just showed up very briefly to wish me a good day while I was half asleep and she didn't put a foot in the actual room. I can't seem to make this evening add up in my head, from the point I brushed my teeth everything is so blurry .
