so, Im the older sibling and I have a brother who is the most annoying POS in existence, for instance, my parents ran a cattery and It was my job to scrub and disenfect the entire fucking house , 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms and a closet, the cats deliberatly shit everywhere and it was so annoying, my father was the only person who actually cleaned up after themselves, while my mother left behind a mountain of dishes and left shit all over the floor, while my younger brother would always throw wrappers and empty cans into our SHARED room which I cleaned entirely, he would never stop talking, he always followed me around, and he would always deny that he caused messes, he cried when my father told him out for turning our living room hallway into a landfill ( his only job in the house was throwing out the trash, and he got paid 5$ a day to walk 175 ft a day to the trashcan, and I was essentially forced to scrub the enitre house of others messes, and I got paid 10$ a day for 15x the work my sibling did) and whats worse is my mother always sided with him, when I told her it was kinda unfair that on a daily bases I was tasked, hmmm, no coerced was the right word, I would have all my shit taken away If my mom wasnt satisfied with a single thing while my brohter always got "just a few more minutes" her excuse? well I pay you 5$ more, as if that covers what a normal cleaner would charge 70$ for, and my god he always got the newest best shit, handed me down his old things, for ex: he recently got a brand new macbook and finally my parents forced him to give me his 2001 acer google chromebook, which cannot function with 2 apps running at the same time, I got his old motorola with 2 gigs of data, while he proceeded to recieve a fucking iphone 11! and then when he breaks his new shit he always dumps it on me or just takes back the stuff he gave me, and plus his excuse for never cleaning up after himself is "well, you get paid to do the job" bitch, I get paid to sanitize our house, not become your maid, and as if me getting paid just erases the fact that I still earn my money fairly, while you get paid to sit on your ass and coo at mommy, hes 13 btw.
