(We met online on xbox on roblox we both had the same character style and outfit just different gender so i met him in game chat and we was friends every since) My life is around love cause I love the idea of love like being with the person you love and exploring new things and places. Soo when me and my bf first met was nice and all we talked everyday and he said I love you and good night n morning everyday now I am the one doing that we met on xbox I am homeschooled I had some trauma in my life i told him about that while it was happening so that made me feel better at that time, we made a promise we would be with eachother until we are older and I can move away and go to college with him which rn I want to leave my home cuz it sucks, we would talk about what we would do if we met and stuff, facetimed every now and then but now I feel he has no time for me in his life even after the virus and no school stuff he always says I gtg bye as soon as I text and I feel he has no interest in the things I show him he just says ok cool gtg bye ily, I usually say I love u full word good night hope your day was good and etc.I try not to text first cause I can be annoying said by alot of ppl and I feel everyday I get further away from him but I love him cause hes decently good looking not my dream man cuz ain't no one getting their dream guy if so u lucky, ight back to the thingy he always plays with his friends and when I play with them they sometimes seem annoyed and assume I always want to play with my bf when I sometimes want to play with them  cause they're nice, maybe I'm clingy cause I have 2 friends idk advice, I love him but I dont know I feel like om getting further apart I asked if we could talk a lil more but still the same
