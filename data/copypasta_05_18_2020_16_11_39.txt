 I did an epic troll on my normie class  My class if full of NORMIES! So I trolled them  So we had a substitute teacher and he went to get something from the  back room. I decided to pin a picture of small Keanu Reeves along with  big Chungus on the wall. Everyone starts saying “Sit down fucking  idiot.” I say “No u” along with “destruction 100.” I’m on the floor  dying right now while the class cannot understand the funny reference.  Then I see some girl next to me on her phone. So I decide to lean and  see what she’s doing. Turns out, she’s an INSTANormie and I yell  “FUCKING NORMIE (with Pepe angry face) REEEEEE. USE REDDIT YOU FUCKING  TUMOR!” Everyone is uncultured and looks at me like a weirdo. The girl  says “The fuck is wrong with you? I don’t care about your stupid  opinions.” I reply by making a Joe Joe reference “DIE NORMIE! (Here  comes Joe Joe reference) MUDA MUDA MUDA!” My class starts yelling at me  calling me autistic because they don’t know memes. The sub comes back  and sees Keanu Chungus and this happens.  Sub: Who did this  Me: Oh I think it was Joe  Sub: What?  Me: JOE Mama  I start Rolf (rolling on the floor laughing) and Xding (XD is an  emoticon for laughing, better than cancer emojis FYI.) My sub gives the  entire class lunch detention and everyone is mad at me but at least it  was epic lol. Just wish people were more cultured in Reddit.  I’d like to remind everyone that after school everyone was talking shit  abt me. So I stood in front of them on the planter T posing going  “mmmmmmmmmmm” and “DOOT DOOT.” Fucking everyone calls me a weirdo. I see  a group of kids on their phones, so I walked and they were playing  Fortnite. So I call them a bunch of autists and how Minecraft is better.  They walked away like a bunch fucking noons. People STARE at me when I  tap them saying “CREEPER....” It’s a Minecraft parody that’s not that  bad musically but they’re supposed to respond with “Aww man.” But nobody  ever does.
