So I have been friend with this boy for over a year. Really close friends that hang out 1 or 2 times a week. We both were dating someone when we met so the friendship became strong and no weird feelings. Well We both broke up with our significant others recently. We’ve been talking and hanging out just the same and he recently told me about this girl he works with, shes really hot and he told me he liked her. He said he got butterflies and what not but he said she was talking to a guy and he said he didn’t think she liked him so he was sad. And I kinda had feelings for him then but he didn’t know this only I did. I was a little sad about this girl I guess but oh well. Well he had a party at his house and I am there, we drink and he is all over me the whole night and he is also talking about the girl and I’m giving him advice. He is being really touchy (as he always is) and he gets me alone and kisses me. He tells me he’s liked me since we met and he’s dreamed of this. I’m a little confused because of the other girl but I’m really happy and I told him I liked him too. We kissed a lot and slept together ( not sex just in the same bed) he asked me if I still liked this other boy I had used to like and I said no. Everything was fine and great. Well it’s been over a week and he doesn’t text me much and leaves me on open after a bit when we do. He still is hanging out with me in person and I can tell he seems nervous but also i am too. He keeps complimenting me though and telling me I’m cute and smiling to himself so I know he definitely has feelings of some sort but the things is what If he likes this other girl more than me ?? I’m not sure how to cope or if he genuinely likes me A LOT and threw the other girl out the window?? I mean We haven’t mentioned that night at all and we both are a little too scared to I think. But do you think I’m in his head over the other girl ? I know I need to talk to him but I’m scared, I will eventually.
