First of all I want to point out that I’m a recovering addict. I’ve been clean for 2 years and a couple months. It’s been a very hard and very eye opening journey, to say the least. I’ve never thought that I would get to this point, never could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I’m here and I finally have some sort of peace in my soul. I had to cut out a lot of people that were toxic to me and my recovery and I don’t regret it one bit. Well, now that y’all have a little more understanding of what I been going through, let’s get to the whole point of this story. Me and “my friend” let’s called her C. We have been friends since I was 20 years old. I’m about to be 34 in May. So let’s say about 12 years. We always had the type of friendship that picks up where it left off even if it had been months without speaking. I always knew I could count on her for support or anything else. I considered her one of my best friends. We did a lot of things together, went to a lot of places. I never had a chick friend that I knew would never stab me in the back. She always lifted me up when I was down and always talked me up when I was depressed. After 2014, I got really bad into drugs, a lot worse than I used too. My ex fiancé got killed in a car accident and that crushed my soul. I never properly mourned his death.Instead of dealing with the grief, I tried to fill that void and hurt with toxic shit. So I wasn’t the same person, her exact words were “ I was a shell of the person I used to be.” This went on for another 3 years. I went to rehab for about a year in 2015, but it was court ordered and I knew that I wasn’t ready to quit and I was scared to deal with the grief of my ex’s death,so I kept using. In 2017 I overdosed and it was bad. It scared me. And that was the moment I decided to get sober. I was done , I had enough of living how I was living. I wanted more for myself. Let’s go back to May of 2016.  May 11 was my birthday and me and C made plans to go to New Orleans for my birthday and just hang out. We were going to make a whole day out of it.I was so excited because we hadn’t seen each other in a few months. Life gets in the way sometimes. Plus she worked a lot and  had just gotten out of a long relationship. We talked and made plans the night before . She was excited and so as I. She said she really missed me and could t wait to see me. The day before my birthday I went to Ulta and bought her a eyeshadow palette. A Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ eyeshadow palette. To be exact. I did this because she is obsessed with mermaids and I just love giving gifts to people, plus that’s my girl and I love making her smile. Anyway, I get up the next day , it’s my birthday and I’m pumped. I text her and everything is still on and so I get dressed. I’m fully dressed and text her I’m ready, what’s up. She takes awhile to text then tells me she’s so sorry her boss called and she has to work a few hours. Oh okay, I said I was disappointed ,but it want the end of the world.so it was about 10. So I wait a couple more hours and it’s about 3. I’m getting kinda upset at this point because she still hasn’t texted me back and let me know what’s up.  She told me  she will get off at 5.ok I was thinking we won’t spend the day , but we can go out at night. She NEVER texted me again......... never replied to me never nothing. It’s 9pm 10pm 11pm. I give up very upset and I’m so pissed that she never even texted me back. If something came up I understand, you don’t just ignore someone. And it was my birthday. Get this. She never texted me called me and a year passed. A freaking year.  It’s We finally hang out and she doesn’t even apologize, she makes little of the situation and never really explained to me what happened. I got the “ you know I love you, I am sorry . Idk what happened bullshit. So whatever I love her and I don’t want to throw away the relationship out just because of that. Anyway after that our relationship never was like it was before, she changed. I felt her trying to compete with me. She would comment snide remarks about me to my face , but would laugh it off and say she was joking. She NEVER did this to me before. I would text her and she would never text me back or would take days to respond. I would see her on Facebook posting memes and shit , but she would ignore me when I would send her a message. Her excuse was she was always”so so busy “ working. So many times I tried to make plans and hang out with her. Never happens same excuse. I talked to her about how I felt and she promised me that our friendship was good . She loved me and she was sorry. I told her I didn’t want to lose touch and that’s what feels like is happening. She agreed and she promised we would get together soon. Every time I texted her no response or it would take forever. She said she would call me back. Never did. Last time I spoke to her , it was October. I told her I loved and and when she gets the chance call me and left it at that. It’s now almost 6 months later and nothing. It’s a world pandemic and I haven’t heard one peep from her. It hurts my heart, but I finally realized she we haven’t been “friends” in a really long time.
