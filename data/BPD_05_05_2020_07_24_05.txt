I've recently divorced my wife after 4 years and I still don't understand why she won't admit she has a problem.  I spent the last 2 years of marriage trying to convince her to goto therapy and it would be good, when the self harm, suicide threats and physical abuse against me got out of control i made it an ultimatum.  Actually several ultimatums and she never took them seriously.  Our couples therapist suggested she has bpd traits, she manipulated her individual therapist and when I confronted her of not talking about suicide she switched to another therapist.  The last therapist spoke with me to get a second opinion of events and after that she was doing CBT along with a DBT workbook.  I never found out if she was diagnosed or not.  Two months after she's still the same, screaming, crazy fights at 2am.  She stopped hitting me and choking me but I just couldn't take it anymore.  They say people with bpd realize they need help when they hit rock bottom, was destroying our marriage not enough.  She says she's cured and she never really needed therapy, she needed just someone to talk to.   She said she hit me because she loves me more than anyone else.  I asked her why won't she commit to therapy and save the marriage, she never replied back and now its like I don't exist.   I don't understand how some people with bpd can be aware of their issues and my ex wife runs from the thought of it.  She saw a book on bpd and said she wants to strangle people who write this crap.  Is acceptance of bpd that hard, i have my own issues and I'm working  on them and I can acknowledge them but is it different for people with bpd, what does it take ?  Also does a person with bpd know what their doing is wrong?, my ex wife is able to justify the verbal and physical abuse, does she really feel that on the inside.  Sorry if the post is all over the place, my mind is all over the place atm.
