Destiny is a game I love. But since the launch of the season of dawn and halfway through season of the undying I have been finding the game somewhat boring, repetitive and unhelpful in regards to finding people to play with (specifically on the PC side of things)
The Vex offensive was pretty much a toned menagerie ripoff with different rewards and a linear line of activities that never changed and proved to be a further disappointment for a LOT of people when the final offensive came out and nothing different really came out of it or unique from my experience anyway. Furthermore there is a lack of spice with the stuff they are adding now like the sundial?! Personally it feels like menagerie again but with a few new gimmicks in this season like the obelisks and bringing back saint-14.  I also loathe how you cannot warm bright dust effectively while I do understand that the game is free to play and that since micro-transactions will always be there regardless of the price tag it makes the game feel dull because the new fun stuff are locked behind a 15$ dollar paywall that I have to pay again ever two and a half months which I don’t like paying when I have already spent double the amount on this game than you would on a newly released triple A title. Another complaint I have is on PC there isn’t any way to find groups to play with effectively (to my knowledge) I have searched for hours on end on the internet on discord, here on reddit to find places to find people to play raids and grind and just do stuff with, with zero success whatsoever and it’s thoroughly disheartening especially when I came from the Xbox scene where in a handful of button presses you find a group looking to do the same thing as you. If you don’t have a group of people a lot of the fun endgame stuff is lock behind either or both a skill wall or a wall that requires others help which you simply cannot get. While the season of dawn campaign has received good reviews I don’t see the reason to spend money or a game that already has demanded so much.
