This story happened last weekend. So I’ve only ever taken Xanax once before this happened, and it was quite awhile ago (it was a weak press as-well) so on this particular night I was at my buddy / plugs house and he had some prescription Xanax 2 mgs, I bought one from him and popped half at his place, about an hour or so later me and another homie I was with dipped back home to my place, at this point I didn’t really feel the half bar yet so I decided to pop the other. BAD move. Not sure when but I blacked out at some point afterwards n my homie headed home, it was probably about 11pm or so, next thing I remember it’s like 2am, not sure what I did that whole time, most likely  sat there drooling like a caveman. Anyways my brain decided I needed to smoke a fat blunt in the garage, this is where it got bad. About 1/4 through the blunt the FUCKING fire alarm starts beeping. Keep in mind it’s 2am with both my parents home and I’m 16. Somehow in my ridiculously barred out state I manage to fling a chair under the alarm and turn it off. I sat their in silence and to my relief my parents somehow didn’t wake up, I then decided I would smoke in my moms unlocked car instead, so just as I’m about to spark up again I look through the car window parked parallel to the house and see my mom in the window, walking to the garage looking fucking pissed. luckily she hadn’t seen me. I quickly got out the car and ran back into the garage and to my dismay the fire alarm was back on somehow. My mom looked at me with a look of complete “what the fuck buddy?”  and roasted me for being a retard and smoking in the house. While she was yelling at me the fact that I had a full pint of lean in my parka jacket had apparently slipped my mind. She told me to go to bed and that we’d talk the next morning. Well that’s my only complete bartard story, it’s not as exciting as the others on this subreddit but I thought it was pretty funny anyways.
