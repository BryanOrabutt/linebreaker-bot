"The Last Dance", sigh...what can be said? It features the basketball legacy of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. The self-styled "docuseries" presents unparalleled insight into the Bull's dynasty. It is a view of their achievements from mostly Mike's perspective through the microcosm of the '90s. And for most, it was an introduction or reintroduction to the style, beauty, and grace of Jordan's sublime performances during that era of basketball.  Incredibly, "The Last Dance" does well to highlight the crux of "the black cat's" greatness. That is, the heavily touted "6-0" (six'n-O), yes, MJ's brilliant NBA finals record. The filmmakers and editors spared no expense on ensuring that the viewer saw the obstacles that Mike had to contend with beyond the court. Yes, those very same "obstacles" that made his achievements not only historic but a feat in and of itself. And boy, did they ever strive to drive that point home! *Now and then, the term"objective filmmaking" has been tossed around... cue cringe.* Don't get me wrong though, "The Last Dance" is certainly an entertaining and insightful project worth the watch (kudos)!  So then, what are we left with? We take Mike's "6-0" juxtaposed to LeBron's dismal 3-9 finals record. I understand that for most Michael Jordan fans, apologists, and ardent supporters, it renders a simple no contest in the "Greatest Of All Time" debate! Yet, the debate not only continues but thrives!  Still,  I want to provide four possible reasons why I think the debate continues. And why, despite all the "evidence" to the contrary, that **#KingJames is the #goat.** **One (1), "Losing" matters:**  In the universe of sports, there is a tradition of rooting for either an individual or a team's success. We marvel at the spectacle of the world's greatest athletes competing, living vicariously through them while finding inspiration through the magnificent performances on display.  The appropriate label for this heavily vested group of people is in the world of sports is known as **fanatics;** commonly known today as fans.    Now, a fan's claim to fame is defined **"year in and year out"** by loyalty to a team or a player. And the only way to prove this **"loyalty"**,  is by **"representing"** for your team or player when they are not on top of the food chain. **Yes, I said it, a true fan is defined by losses not wins.** This is the **"right of passage"** in sports culture.  And it is reasonable to understand why. Think about it this way. After an epic team loss, the media spotlight moves away, criticism and gloating from the victors loom overhead. Amid this failure, when enduring the feeling of shared loss, athletes and the fans build somewhat of an intimate connection; a sense of solidarity if you will.  This tried and tested loyal club of supporters is known as **"true fans".**  Now, given the quality of the high-level failures that LeBron James has encountered in his professional career, it is safe to say that ***"The Kang"*** **has tons of true fans.** *The 2007 finals sweep, 2009 Loss to Dwight's Magic ECF, 2010 Boston beat down, 2010 the decision, 2011 "the frozen one", 2014 record finals blowout to the Spurs, Finals 2015 loss to GSW, 2017 & 18 Finals loss to GSW. Eight straight trips to the finals, for three wins, no bandwagon required.* Still, the hidden part of the narrative here, why losses matter, is that **heroes are not always winners**. For example, Jesus of Nazareth, Leonidas I of Sparta, Hannibal Barca of Carthage, Patrice Lumumba of the Congo, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, and Dr. Martin Luther King. All respective heroes, not necessarily winners. Though not to be defined as political or spiritual, LeBron has found himself among this vestige of men. His consistent ability to **#striveforgreatness** against formidable foes both on the basketball court and the mainstream media has made him a modern-day hero to some. To continue, LeBron's noteworthy pursuit of excellence, not cheating the game with effort, has handcrafted somewhat of a roller-coaster career like no other. It has seen him through to the **lowest lows and highest highs** with all the twists and turns in-between. The results, a battle-hardened group of **true fans** that have appreciated the roller coaster journey; and what a ride it continues to be. #witnesses To LeBron's greatness, he has embodied the motif of the **phoenix,** repeatedly rising from the ashes of epic losses. **Somehow he represents both the greatest superstar meltdown in NBA history in 2011 and has arguably engineered the greatest comeback win in NBA history;** earmarking the feat by leading both teams in all major statistical categories. So then it's no surprise that to date, his career has been **equally satisfying for haters and supporters** alike, making his sensational play "box office" for those who want to revel in his defeat or celebrate in his victories. Honestly, few people can relate to being "dominant" like MJ was in their respective fields of expertise. Whether in a profession or hobby, most of our lives are tempered with a cycle of successes and failures. Maybe that's why the archetypical hero is one that losses in the beginning and wins in the end? You know, arc to arc, the thing that makes a good story a saga. **It somehow grows, it inspires, it connects, it lends to the narrative.** Point is, losses and defeats add a compelling intrigue to a hero story like nothing else. We only need to look to the Marvel Universe's " Avengers" for a relevant example. One of the highest-grossing films of all time. It features an epic defeat followed by an epic win as a notable part of the series. As it relates, LeBron's career has the potential to become the greatest story in NBA history. His beginnings, the expectation, the decision, the incessant criticism, the hard-fought victories against the odds continue to define the narrative cycle of his career. Put it this way, we know what happened in Dallas, then he redeemed himself with his comeback win against the Warriors. Then recently he had the first injury of his career and misses the playoffs #washedking if somehow LeBron becomes the first player to win three finals MVPs for three franchises this season, he will successfully supplant the moniker of journeyman to a conqueror.  What a potential legacy! What an epic story!  **Two (2) The "Physical era" is overstated:**  Take a look at the '80s and '90s basketball era, the first thing you notice are those short shorts. The second thing you notice, is that the guys on the floor just move a tick slower, and the movements on the basketball court are not as dynamic as it is today. It is a fact that the athletes today are bigger, stronger, and faster on average. But the game is somehow "softer"? Following popular public commentary, It comes down to the **hand-check rule** in that era.  Before 2004, players in the league could engage in contact with an offensive player without a foul call. In that era, refereeing allowed the contest to flow with an **aggressive style of play**. Seriously, a flagrant foul was almost nonexistent and offensive and defensive fouls came from the school of hard knocks. This was the **era of less-skilled physically gifted players taking the role of enforcers.** It was also an era where the bigger stronger skilled players dominated. Nowadays, people say that this era made it that much harder for Jordan to be as dominant. I beg to differ! Come on, the **defensive player of the year and 9x defensive first-team selection and 3x steal champion seems to agree with me that Jordan was in his element.** Remember, this was an era of great big men, not the era of guards. And what is the achilles heel of all big men? They can not bring the ball up the floor, they need guard play to be successful. Jordan and Pippen were elite big guards at their position in that era, perfectly placed to handicap the opposing offense and the big man's ability to dominate the game. Simply take a look at the footage, we see Jordan and Pippen steering, stiff-arming, pushing, hacking, and bullying the smaller players on the wing on defense. On offense, they still could hit with low shoulders and moving shoves if the defender was in the act of hand-checking, and the referee would not "call it".The point here is, **the ability to hand-check greatly improved Mike's impact on the game.** **The rule worked as an advantage for him, not a disadvantage, so stop the nonsense.**  Today, defense boils down to forcing players to change direction, deflections, and disrupting the passing lanes. This is commonly employed as "zone defense" today. However in that era, it was known as illegal defense. It is important to understand, zone defense allows defenders to roam the sweet spots of offensive players and set more sophisticated defensive schemes by committee. **I think this era, lacking the hand-checking, would handi-cap the intensity of Jordan's elite defense. I'll go so far as to say it would compromise his impact on the game in clutch situations; not being able to impose the full extent of his physical will because of the way the game is now played.** So maybe Jordan averages 50 in this era, but his opponent would be right behind him with 38.  On the flip side, no question about it, I see Lebron James flourishing in the '90s. His size, speed, and ability to make contact on smaller guards, it'll be like lambs to the slaughter. He would probably never have to use a spin move because you just got away with more offensive fouls on the drive in that era. And if you needed to, you could issue a brutal offensive foul or two to let the defender know **"move when you see the freight train coming",  no flagrant foul call.** Knowing the cerebral player that he is in this era, I see him **exploiting the rule to dominate.** After all, he's **built for it;** r**unner-up for defensive player of the year, 6x all-defensive first team, while handicapped by the way the game is played today.** **Three (3) Sustained Greatness:** LeBron has sustained the highest level of play over the longest career stretch in the NBA today.  There have been all kinds of naysayers exclaiming that his totals don't equate greatness but rather that he started earlier and has played longer than most of the greats who achieved more. Well, to that I say, **starting early isn't an option of your not good enough, and** he certainly was. His selection from highschool was validated with the Rookie of Year award. His longevity since that point is nothing but a marker of mental discipline. "You cheat your body, it will cheat you". LeBron's mental discipline to maintain his health for so long has yielded groundbreaking results for his career.  It's like this, Mike left the game willingly **TWICE**, Kobe broke down after his 17th year and left unwillingly, LeBron year 17...still going steady.  Mr. 34k 9k 9k is still open for business. **Four (4) Jordan's lack of rivalry:** To the Michael Jordan "stans", consider this, what if Magic Johnson doesn't prematurely retire in 1992?  Follow where I am going with this for a second. Now, was Mike the best player in the league then? Undoubtedly! But as a team sport, **the best player in the league doesn't win a championship every year the best team does**. I believe this was meant to be Magic's role by default, to slow down the rise of the Jordan dynasty. I think his premature retirement removed the gatekeeper and premier competitor to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the early '90s. Maybe, instead of 3 championships Jodan wins 2, maybe 1, and possibly doesn't retire. Fact, Magic's '91 Laker team stands alone as the only team that Jordan played in the Finals that were favored to win; however slight of a favorite they were. Not convinced? Think of it like this, imagine if Magic roamed the '80s with no Bird? Is it unreasonable to think he wins 6 or 7 championships? I don't think so considering the quality of his teams, coaching, and that he had 9 finals appearances.  "The Last Dance" did well to skim over the NBA epoch of Magic Johnson's announcement. I thought it both convenient and suspect, as ESPN ranks this moment as one of the top 25 epochs in all of sports! It would be like LeBron playing in a league with a recently retired Tim Duncan. He maybe ends up 6-9 stays in Miami and never goes back to Cleveland. Food for thought.  #akronassassin #KingJames #kidfromakron
