I bought a 4 year old ball python off of craigslist about three weeks ago. Super sweet if a bit shy. I’ve kept him in the same enclosure with the same husbandry (as far as i know) that he’s used to, as everything I needed came with the purchase. I gave him a week to settle in and have been handling him for about half an hour every other day. The problem is that he seems to be getting scared of me. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong; I try to be gentle when I take him out, I set him in my lap and let him explore at his own pace and gently pull him away if he’s going somewhere he’s not supposed to. He gets a little flighty sometimes  in which case I put him up, but today he seemed downright terrified of me. I picked him up and set him in my lap, he unballed within a minute. Every time my hand got anywhere close to his head, he jerked back like I was about to kill him. Even movement almost a foot away scared him. Bumping his head against my leg scared him. I genuinely thought he was going to strike at me. I put him up after about five minutes. He seems to get progressively more skittish each time I take him out and I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. Could it be hunger? He hasn’t eaten for a month. The previous owners told me he only eats every month and a half to two months, which seemed weird to me, but I wanted to try and do what he was used to. They fed him medium f/t rats. For reference he’s about three feet long and a little over two pounds. Doesn’t look starved or overweight. He’s been more active at night the past few days- climbing all over the enclosure walls and bumping against the top of the tank constantly, and moving really fast while he does so. Still sleeps through the day. He shed just over three weeks ago so he isn’t going into blue. Scales and head look fine. Please help, I don’t want him to be scared of me but I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.
