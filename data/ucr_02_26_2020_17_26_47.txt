I just need to vent my feelings out. I’m a second year Biochemistry major, and I haven’t been doing good with my classes these past two years. I feel like no matter how much I study or rewrite notes or do practice problems I end up doing so shit on my exams. I feel defeated and I don’t want to give up but it’s really just making me feel like I don’t belong here. I’ve gotten only like 3 A’s but they’re just breadth classes not classes pertaining to my major. I’ve gotten C’s & B’s in my math and science courses and I just feel like I can’t get past that no matter how hard I try. I always see that I do better on finals than midterms but it’s too late at that point as my midterm grades are way too low for me to even get to a B+ or A-. I’m taking Bio 5B and Chem8B and I just bombed both of those midterms because they landed on the same day and I feel like I got overwhelmed with the amount of info from both classes, but it’s just going to get harder from here. I’m so worried that I’ve screwed up so much that I don’t think I would be able to succeed after I graduate or go to graduate school because of how bad my grades are. I suffer from depression and anxiety and even though I try to find ways to reduce feeling anxious all the time or having such negative thoughts about everything it somehow finds a way for me to make me feel shitter about myself and makes me feel hopeless. I know this is a long post and it doesn’t make much sense because I’m just all over the place, but I just wanted to vent and to see if anyone was in the same boat as I was at one point. Does it get better? How did you guys find a way to dig yourself out of this mental pitfall? If you read this far thank you so much for reading; this isn’t a post to garner pity but rather I just wanted to see how people were able to succeed even when success seemed slim.
