2 types of car Karins type 1: the cops will believe me Karin: I like your car op: you can not have it Karin: hits op and calls him your a c\*nt, pedophile, s\*\*\*, a\* and then call the cops also, Karin:\*thinks the police will belive op hacked photoshopped the video surveillance(while his phone was in the car), changed the license plate, and hit hurt with so much force it opened up 7 bullet holes, 91 stab wounds and a knife and gun in her pocket, and op will get arrested\*   type 2:me / my son deserves it Karin: nice car op: thanks  Karrin: can I have it op: no it is my car and I spend all my money on it Karrin: I and my son deserve it op: it's my car Karrin: MY SOM AND I HAVE BEEN SHOOKING FOR A 9TH CAR. WE WORK HARD TO MAKE A PAYPAL ACCOUNT SO MY PARENTS CAN GIVE ME ONLY 5 MILL A DAY. op: I am struggling for money, my mom and dad and grandpa and grandma have died, and the other 2 have type 4 cancer in 26934 parts of their body Karrin: DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS LIKE TO BE A SINGLE MOTHER op: you make 5 mills a day from your parents, I can only afford to eat once a month Karrin: slaps op ME AND MY SON ARE LOOKING VERY HARD TO FIND A CAR, WE LIKE YOURS SO GIVE IT TO US then one of these happen: a: Karren tries to take his keys if she succeeds, she will probably try to drive off in the car, but op will pull him out of the seat, then will call the cops and say she assaulted him, and she would get caught on camera and get brought to court and loose. if she fails he will threaten to call the cops and she will back off(probably not, but I wrote a lot already) b: you stole it she will say you stole it from someone, rarely she says her, and to give her the keys so she can give it back to its "rightful owner" she will call the cops when op says no and op will show then insurance and other stuff(give me a break) and the cops will let op drive off   there are more types but i wrote a lot
