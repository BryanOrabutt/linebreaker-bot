Alright guys! So when I was 20 years old, I went out to the pool club with a group of friends to hang out and chill. We played a couple of games and after a while got tired so we sat on the side, just talking amongst each other and having fun. I decided that I was gonna go get something to drink and asked everyone what they wanted. As I made my way to grab the drinks, this lady approaches me and greets me with a “Hello”. She was drop dead gorgeous. Blonde hair, blue eyes. You get the deal. We started to talk and we really hit it off. Long story short, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and she replied with “yes” in the quickest way you can imagine. I just laughed it off and she started to do this weird laugh afterwards and I made my way back to my friends and told them about everything that happened. Fast forward to next Friday, I asked her if she wanted me to pick her up and she declined and told me to meet her at the restaurant even though we agreed that I would pick her up before. I shrugged it off and went straight to the restaurant. I live about 5 minutes from the restaurant so I decided to walk their and if need be, I’d use my car to drop her off or whatever. When I get there, I see her already sitting at the table, looking around the restaurant. When I had called her to ask her how long it would take her, she said about an hour since she lived pretty far and as soon as the phone call ended I made my way to the restaurant. I got there in like 7 minutes so you guys can do the math. Confused, I stand back for a while observing her behavior which was very odd. I just thought she might be nervous about the date so I went to greet her and everything. After a great night of chit chat and amazing food, we decided that we would take a stroll. As we are walking, she asks if I can drop her off. At first I hesitate as I see the Toyota car keys dangling from her purse but being the gentlemen I am, I agree to drop her off without questioning her about the keys. The whole ride there was super awkward. She didn’t say a word and when I tried to start a convo she wouldn’t answer. After an hour ride which seemed to last a lifetime, we reached her house and I stopped the car. As soon as I put the car on park, she got up and jumped on top of me, kissing me. I obviously didn’t mind at all 😂😂. After a couple of minutes kissing, she invites me into her house. I gladly offered and we got to it 😂. After a while, I asked if I could crash at her place because I was tired and didn’t want to make the drive out and she sort of hesitated but agreed. She told me to sleep on the couch while she slept in the bedroom. She gives me a blanket and we call it a night. I don’t really fall asleep that quick so I decide to use my phone for a bit and chat with a couple of my friends before I sleep. Then all of a sudden, I start to hear crying and stomping. Shocked, I put my phone away and start to listen to what was going on. She started shouting, screaming, and cried louder and shouted words like die, and some other weird shit I didn’t even understand. Not gonna lie I was scared to see what was going on so I stayed on the couch acting like I was asleep. All of a sudden the “tantrum” stops and the door swings open. The blanket I was using was knitted so there were holes all over it so I used one of the whole to see if she was looking and there she was, naked, hair all fucked up, looking dead at me. She was just standing there. I started to hear thing all around me fall to the floor. If she was standing in front of me, how were these things falling. I kept an eye on her the whole time thinking to myself, “what the fuck have I gotten myself into”. After a couple of minutes of her just standing there, she walks over to the drawer to the right of me and I slowly move towards my right, keeping an eye on her. Before she even made it to the drawer, it opened. At this point I was praying to god, tears going down my eyes. Behind me, I heard the door opening and closing, opening and closing and I was at the point where I was about to rush out of here and beat this lady if i had to when all of a sudden she comes rushing at me. In the blink of an eye, she was on top of me trying to choke me. Mind you I was 6’5 270 lbs at the time and I was having trouble getting her off me and she was maybe 5’5 5’6 130 pounds. I held her by the head and pushed her away and got up as quick as possible. I grabbed my backpack and took out my gun and aimed it at her. I realized that it wasn’t loaded but I tried not to make it hot that I had no ammo. I walked backwards towards the door, keeping my eye on her at all times and this bitch picked her hand up and the fucking fridge fell down. She picked her other hand up and the TV fell. When I seen that, I ran like Usian Bolt out that crib and into my car. She was running after me. I got in my car, turned it on and she was running alongside my car and gave it a good punch and the mirror broke. How the fuck does she break the mirror in one fucking punch. I said fuck nah and slammed the gas. She fell backwards and stayed on the floor. My friend and I visited the house the next day, making sure we had ammo just Incase things went sideways but we saw nothing. No car, no movement and not her. Scariest day of my life. I’m still wondering what she was cause she wasn’t no human. This bitch really made things fall with her hands. Well thanks for reading guys!
