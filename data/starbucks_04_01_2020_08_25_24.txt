There’s an open 24 hr Starbucks DT near my area that I’ve recently been going to since my store and all the other cafe ones closed. My first time there, me and boyfriend got into an argument and he drove away after we ordered. (beside the fact I didn’t get anything, of course I was disappointed that the partners had to make it) anyway we pull up the second night and we get recognized because of my unusual drink and the partner was very nice and friendly about it, even joked with us and playfully asked why we left (all was cool) and I was able to leave with my partner numbers and mark out being used with new policy. So then we go today and we’re met with this big miserable lady and when I inform her I would like to use my numbers, she then asks to see my ID which I’m confused by since it’s never happened before. My boyfriend kind of got frustrated with me because I asked him to give me a minute so I could look up if there was new policy on this since I actually did not have my ID on me, pressured, I just decide to pay without using my numbers but make sure to take the receipt to which she says “that’s fine” as if it’s her choice, the POS clearly asks you to ask the customer if they want their receipt. Anyway I felt a bit thrown off because even after she aware I didn’t have my ID, she still didn’t “make the moment” right to me as a fellow partner and from what I know it’s not official policy on the hub even though I may be wrong. Anyway i want to go back and encounter her again and politely show her my ID and ask the difference be refunded but I would also like to take her DMs contact and inform her of my concern for rude behavior when handing my receipt and not prioritizing making the moment right especially during our pandemic. I don’t mean to sound like a Karen but it’s upsetting seeing improper partner behavior because I for sure wouldn’t have handled the situation that way especially if I’m voluntarily working.
