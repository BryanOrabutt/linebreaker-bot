Long story short recovering porn addict here and I just realized how I completely played myself with lust and perversion I'll skip right to it I have been going out with this girl for almost a year and Everytime we have sex I feel like my 5.5 inch penis  does nothing for her she literally just lays there with her eyes open  and dosent even moan if I'm not fingering/damn near fisting using cucumbers or  using something huge  it has always made me feel like shit especially since porn has always made me feel like I needed a huge cock to be truly loved by a woman /satisfy her sexually .....and recently something developed in light of me always feeling like I wasn't enough I started fearing the thought of her cheating with a well endowed man I felt like maybe she would because as a porn addict I have fantasized about pornstars with big butts ....but the strangest thing I would fear her doing it with someone else but I started to get turned on by it it's so weird because I am hurt at the thought of her doing such a thing but the perversness of it makes me cum so hard when I masturbate thinking of it I feel ashamed and embarrassed and hurt at the thought that maybe deep down that's what she wants and I could never give that to her ....I finally told her yesterday to see if she was down for it .....I wasn't gonna do it I guess I wanted to see if she would so I could know if she was the right one for me to see if she was a good woman ......and then she confessed to lying to me about watching porn and told me that she has thought of me fucking other girls while we were having sex and it turned her on and it's so crazy because on one hand the perversness of it all makes me a horny dog but I also feel betrayed and think that I could never take her seriously now because she lied about sexual things .....like I would literally ask her If she watched porn and she would always say no with conviction ......right now shes at home and I'm at work and I don't even trust her .... I don't even know how to feel someone please help
