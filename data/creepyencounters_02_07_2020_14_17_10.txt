This just happened to me but it’s weirding me out so much. I’m a college student and often go shopping by myself. I’m really small and have a baby face so I look really young. I never have encounters but see older men staring at me and always keep an eye out but I’ve never had a experience like this. When I came home me and my mom went to the hair store. We’re looking for a particular item in some aisles in the back with other people. A man passes by and it’s nothing out of the ordinary. I see him looking at me but didn’t think nothing more of it. Then he passes again when my mom is slightly turned and I’m faced the opposite way. He basically brushes against me then whispers in my ear. I don’t know what he said but I heard the word pretty. I just stood there looking at him unsure what to do and watch him leave the aisle while staring at me. My mom tells me to look for something on another aisle. I do but watch around me. I go to the aisle and it’s deserted and a little bit shady. I start to walk further down but turn around bc I shouldn’t bs walking this far. But then out of the corner of my eye I see the man walking fast towards me. I don’t know what to do, thought about running then my mom comes over and he practically runs away. My mom said she saw him acting shady and looking at me and came over here. Idk what he would’ve done if my mom didn’t come, probably try to hit on me. But I feel he had more ulterior motives like he wanted to do something to me. Me and my mom stayed together and both looked around when we left. It was honestly kinda scary bc what if I wasn’t with my mom. The way he was circling around made me feel like he would’ve tried to follow me to the car.  Also he was visibly older and I look visibly young. I feel like this person tries to talk to girls even younger than me. Kinda shaken by it
