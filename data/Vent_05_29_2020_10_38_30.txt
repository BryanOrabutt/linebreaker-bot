I have been living with my longest standing friend of 25yrs for about a year now, things were going good able to keep shit paid and hardly behind having a grand old time whenever we could. Granted when I moved in with my buddy I never knew how (and I love my homie) nasty and disgusting he likes to live in a place... The apt was already quite nasty when I moved in with him but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. Keeping a 2 man "party pad" clean isn't difficult so long as everyone who comes to party pitches in to clean which doesn't happen, but somewhere along the line he hops into a quick relationship (like a week of talking and then dating) which I'm not knocking but it was a bit fast to me because not even a whole month she moved in with us. Now there are three grown ass adults living together, I tried to keep the place clean as best as I could with both my buddy and his gf not cleaning a GOD DAMN THING. Trash piles up inside, dishes pile in the sink, and I'm the only one making sure the cats are fed, watered, and have clean litter, so since they don't even attempt to clean I have absolutely stopped cleaning except for the cats. But I am here making this post now because I am FUCKING TIRED WAKING UP WITH BED BUGS ON ME. We have had bed bugs since mid last year I believe and I haven't had money to get the shit taken care of, now my roommate has know about them since we got them because it started in his bed he bought for 100 bucks from some random ass dude and with me constantly saying we need to get an exterminator and he said he would handle it but HASN'T STILL. I fucking hate how I'm fucking living since I haven't been able to make changes but now I'm working again and I'm about to burn this shit the fuck down and when they decide to move out and since I'm not worthy of letting be know what's going on with you and your gf plan wise with living situation I can't wait for them to move so I can live in a clean environment
