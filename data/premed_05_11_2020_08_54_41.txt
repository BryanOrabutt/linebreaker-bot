My life is literally one big struggle(too many reasons to get into, and mostly financial). In the past when I tried to enroll in colleges I couldnâ€™t do so because of my age and fafsa asks for my parents tax information and they NEVER had it. Me being determined to make it happen I just decided to start at a CC taking a couple classes at a time and just pay for it myself until I could get financial aid and then would transfer to a university. I mean to me getting some pre-reqs out of the way is better than just waiting until I didnâ€™t need my parents info for fafsa. It was going well, but of course financial problems struck. Literally every stupid thing I did when I was careless and young has came back to bite me and Iâ€™m LITERALLY paying for it. Now I canâ€™t go back to school because I canâ€™t enroll until I pay my remaining balance which honestly isnâ€™t extremely crazy but I just canâ€™t afford the amount right now. Iâ€™m only a freshman, Iâ€™ve only taken 4 pre-reqs, and I just feel like Iâ€™m getting nowhere. Iâ€™ve yet to shadow doctors, volunteer, gain clinical experience, or do anything of the other requirements for med school. My car also got repoâ€™d which would make it difficult to even get to places to get all of the hours/volunteering and stuff that I need. Also since this whole stupid covid thing happened I was one of the people who couldnâ€™t work one of my two jobs. I had to get two jobs in the first place to get me out of this hole Iâ€™m in. The job that Iâ€™m still able to work at is not enough to get me out of all of my expensive financial problems. Or even save up for a car. I see all my friends getting all of their pre-reqs done, some are already applying to med school, and some are already in. I also see my other friends who are already working in their healthcare related field, and I just really want to be there already. Iâ€™m well aware that the career path Iâ€™ve chosen definitely doesnâ€™t happen overnight. I know my life wonâ€™t always be one big struggle but itâ€™s frustrating. They say becoming a doctor is a marathon, and not a race(I think thatâ€™s how the saying goesðŸ˜‚), but I feel like I canâ€™t even get passed the start line!!!!!
