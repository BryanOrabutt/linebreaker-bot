 hi im new to reddit and i came here to share my information on fortnite  chapter 2 season 3, to everyone out there who is curious. i know all the  map changes, vehicles,skins AND even an upcoming big collaboration with  fortnite. firstly there are a few map changes coming to next season and  i can confirm that the old map is not coming back but infact old  aspects of the map will be making a return. some of these POIs that will  be making a return will be: greasy grove, tilted towers and last but  not least OG factories. the few vehicles are going to be a 2 player  ridable vehicle that will make a good addition to fortnite another one  is going to be more of a mobility item but if you have played paladins  you will know there is an item in the game that allows you to create  your own zipline which will be another good addition. NOW, for the part  you have been waiting for, the event and the battle pass skins.for tier 1  of the battle pass there is going to be a skin called starline and  salvage. tier 100 is  a female black knight called "the queen" her  description will be "dare test the tempest" not quite sure what this  means but im sure it will fit in with the storyline. that is all i have  although there is an event named doomsday but that is for this season  but there is another called "wrath of the tempest" still not sure what  it means but im sure it will fit in to the storyline also the next  season is called chapter 2 season 3: the great flood and the theme is  water if any big youtubers want to use this make sure to shout me out  please im trying to get to 1k and i have just shared all the next season  my youtube is draxy - fortnite :) thanks for listening and if you think  this is fake come back next season to apologse :)  # fortniteleaks  #  ghostninja  #
