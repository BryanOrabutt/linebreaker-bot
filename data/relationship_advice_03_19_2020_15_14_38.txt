I have been friends with a guy for 17 years. I have been friends with this guy since middle school. Last year we crossed the line and slept with each other. We spent all year going back and forth between being friends and sleeping with each other. He hung out with me more than any of his other friends. He would also sleep with other girls. I slept with another guy, but we would always come back to each other. Multiple nights we wouldnt even hook up we would just sleep in the same bed. There were nights where I would wake up to him cuddling me, touching me, holding my hand, having our legs intertwined, ect. We went on a trip out of town this past winter. A trip I paid for for his birthday. When we came back, he was talking to a girl he was getting ready to introduce to his family, but he started sleeping with me at the same time. This other girl ended up having an std and he ended things with her. This caused us to have a huge fight because he put me in jeopardy. I turned my phone off one night and he spent the whole night looking for me and even filed a missing persons report. The next day I saw him and it was the first time I saw him cry. I know I scared him and hurt him, but he all year was hurting me too. I developed feelings for him. I told him I was the girl for him. I thought we would continue to be friends but he has been acting so hot and cold. One minute we are friends. He cares about me. Blah blah. The next he is telling me we canâ€™t hang out alone at his house or he is ignoring me. Random nights (most likely he has been drinking) he will flirt with me or ask for photos. Then the next day, super cold and distant. To me, he cant control himself around me, so not seeing me is his solution. He is 30 years old, never commits to people, drinks almost every day. What do I do? I just want my friend back but he cant seem to move forward. Help! Any advice will really help!
