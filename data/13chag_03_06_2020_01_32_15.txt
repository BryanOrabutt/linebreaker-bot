POPULAR CULTURE INFLUENCES THE  WAYS THAT MILLIONS, AND PERHAPS BILLIONS, OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE THINK  ABOUT THE WORD “BIKINI.” CONSUMERS OF POPULAR CULTURE LIKELY ASSOCIATE  “BIKINI” WITH THE BATHING SUIT, AND THOSE WHO WATCH THE CARTOON  SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS ENCOUNTER BIKINI BOTTOM AS THE AQUATIC HOME OF THE  EPONYMOUS BRIGHT YELLOW SPONGE AND HIS FRIENDS (BARKER 2018). STEPHEN  HILLENBURG, THE CREATOR OF SPONGEBOB, PASSED AWAY IN 2018, A YEAR THAT  EXTENDED THE CULTURAL TSUNAMI OF HIS CREATIONS TO EVEN LARGER AUDIENCES  AND WIDER PUBLIC ACCLAIM THAN EVER BEFORE, INCLUDING A TONY AWARD  NOMINATION FOR SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS: THE MUSICAL (2016). SOCIAL MEDIA  LIT UP WITH MESSAGES ABOUT HILLENBURG’S PASSING, NOTING IT AS A SAD DAY  FOR BIKINI BOTTOM AND FANS OF THE SHOW. MISSING FROM THE OBITUARIES AND  TRIBUTES TO HILLENBURG’S LEGACY, HOWEVER, WAS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE  NORMALIZATION OF COLONIAL AND MILITARY VIOLENCE ENGENDERED THROUGH HIS  CARTOON DEPICTION OF BIKINI BOTTOM. DESPITE BEING PRESENTED AS A  NONSENSICAL AND HARMLESS CARTOON, SPONGEBOB SHAPES GLOBAL PERCEPTIONS OF  THE ACTUAL PLACE CALLED BIKINI. THE CARTOON DESENSITIZES VIEWERS TO THE  VIOLENCE OF SETTLER COLONIALISM, NORMALIZES AND ERASES THE DISPLACEMENT  OF THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL LAND, AND WHITEWASHES US  MILITARY RAMPAGES ON THE ISLANDS IN THE HISTORY AND NARRATIVES OF  BIKINI. IT RENDERS A PARTICULARLY PERNICIOUS HARM ON MARSHALLESE WOMEN,  WHO ARE FREQUENTLY BOTH SEXUALIZED AND ERASED (TEAIWA 2010; ARVIN, TUCK,  AND MORRILL 2013), THROUGH THE CARTOON’S APPROPRIATION OF THEIR  HOMELANDS. THE SETTLING OF SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS AND HIS FRIENDS INTO  BIKINI BOTTOM IS CONNECTED TO BROADER ENTANGLEMENTS OF MILITARY  COLONIALISM IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS THAT INCLUDE DISPOSSESSION FROM AND  DESTRUCTION OF THE LAND, EXPLOITATION OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR RESOURCES,  AND AN OTHERING OF THE BIKINIAN AND MARSHALLESE PEOPLE.  346 THE  CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) SEEKING TO ADDRESS THESE ERASURES AND  DISPLACEMENTS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SYMBOLIC ERASURE OF THE  REAL-LIFE PEOPLE OF BIKINI ATOLL THROUGH SPONGEBOB AND CONSIDERS THE  COSTS OF MAINTAINING A SINGULARLY SUBMERGED VIEWPOINT THAT DISCONNECTS  THE LAGOON BOTTOM FROM HOLISTIC MARSHALLESE CONSTRUCTIONS OF PLACE,  WHICH, RATHER THAN SEEING THE AIR, LAND, AND SEA AS SEPARATE DOMAINS, AS  REPRESENTED IN THE CARTOON, MAINTAIN THE INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN  THESE REALMS. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOW DISRUPT THE NORMALIZATION OF  VIOLENT SETTLER BEHAVIOR IN OCEANIA BY EXPOSING THE WAYS THAT  SPONGEBOB’S ENCROACHMENT ON BIKINI ATOLL MAINTAINS AN AMERICAN MILITARY  HEGEMONY THAT ERASES INTERGENERATIONAL VIOLENCE AGAINST THE MARSHALLESE  PEOPLE. I ARGUE THAT DESPITE THE SETTLING IN OF SPONGEBOB ON THE BOTTOM  OF BIKINI’S LAGOON, WHICH EFFECTIVELY REMOVES OUR GAZE FROM THE  BIKINIANS LIVING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR LAND AND SEASCAPES, THE  MARSHALLESE PEOPLE ASSERT THEIR PRESENCE IN THE FACE OF SETTLER COLONIAL  EFFORTS TO “ELIMINATE THE NATIVE” (WOLFE 2016) BY CONSISTENTLY  INCORPORATING THE BOTTOM OF THE LAGOON INTO THEIR COSMOLOGIES AND THE  DOMAIN OF THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE ON THE SURFACE. A DIVERSE ARRAY OF  MARSHALLESE CULTURAL PRACTICES—INCLUDING LANGUAGE, STORYTELLING,  WEAVING, AND THE SAILING OF OUTRIGGER CANOES—EMBODY THE STRENGTH AND  RESILIENCE OF THE MARSHALLESE PEOPLE, WHO ENDURED THE EQUIVALENT OF  NUCLEAR WAR ON THEIR ISLANDS AND TRANSMIT THEIR RESILIENCE TO SUCCESSIVE  GENERATIONS.1 INSINUATION AS A FORM OF RESILIENCY: BIKINI BOTTOM IS NOT  A FICTIONAL PLACE OCEANIAN SCHOLAR VICENTE DIAZ ACKNOWLEDGED THE  TENACITY AND RESILIENCE OF PACIFIC ISLANDER CULTURE AND ITS ABILITY “TO  RECLAIM A SPACE FOR ITSELF EVEN IF IT MUST INSINUATE ITSELF WITHIN THE  STORIES OF OTHERS WHO HAVE COME TO THE ISLAND FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS  AND MACHINATIONS” (2001, 175). THIS IDEA IS INTRIGUING TO CONSIDER AS IT  APPLIES TO THE PEOPLE OF BIKINI ATOLL IN THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL  ISLANDS AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT BIKINIANS ENVISION AND ENACT FOR  RECLAIMING SPACE. AS DIAZ NOTED, “INDIGENOUS CULTURE AND HISTORY AND  MEMORY OCCUR IN AND ON (AND EVEN AGAINST) TERMS ESTABLISHED AND  MAINTAINED BY AMERICAN HEGEMONY AS MANIFEST IN POSTWAR DISCOURSES”  (2001, 175). AS I WILL DISCUSS, MARSHALLESE MAINTAIN NUMEROUS CULTURAL  FORMS THAT RECLAIM ANCESTRAL CONNECTIONS TO SPACES AMERICAN POSTWAR  DISCOURSE ATTEMPTED TO ERADICATE BY DESIGNATING THE AREA AS THE “PACIFIC  PROVING GROUND,” A PHENOMENON THAT LINGERS THROUGH THE SETTLER  BARKER •  UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 347 EXISTENCE OF SPONGEBOB ON BIKINI BOTTOM.  TOGETHER, MARSHALLESE CULTURE, HISTORY, AND MEMORY WORK AGAINST THE  GLOBAL PHENOMENON OF SPONGEBOB, DEMONSTRATING “ENDURING INDIGENEITY” AND  MARSHALLESE INTENTIONS TO “EXIST, RESIST, AND PERSIST” (KAUANUI 2016).  RUSSELL HICKS, NICKELODEON’S PRESIDENT OF CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND  PRODUCTION, BOASTED THAT “THE SHOW AIRS IN 170 COUNTRIES, AND THEY TELL  ME THAT EVERY HALF SECOND, SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD IS  INTERACTING WITH SPONGEBOB IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. EVERY HALF SECOND! IT  BLOWS MY MIND. . . . AND IT’S NOT JUST THE 75 MILLION FACEBOOK LIKES OR  THE 1 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON TWITTER. SPONGEBOB GETS AROUND. HE’S PLAYED  SOCCER WITH MICHELLE OBAMA AND DAVID BECKHAM, AND BRIGHTENED UP  PHARRELL’S FEET. NOT BAD FOR AN INVERTEBRATE, RIGHT?” (QUOTED IN BECK  2013, 11). HICKS WAS CORRECT THAT SPONGEBOB, HIS QUIRKY FRIENDS, AND THE  OTHER RESIDENTS OF THE FICTIONAL TOWN OF BIKINI BOTTOM HAVE ACHIEVED  MASSIVE GLOBAL RECOGNITION. IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE PERVASIVENESS OF  THE AMERICAN HEGEMONIC DISCOURSE OF SPONGEBOB, PEOPLE WORLDWIDE KNOW  LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, ABOUT THE NONFICTIONAL RESIDENTS OF THE REAL-LIFE  BIKINI BOTTOM, OR BIKINI ATOLL. FOR SPONGEBOB AUDIENCES, BIKINI BOTTOM  APPEARS AS AN AMALGAM OF TOKEN OBJECTIFICATIONS OF OCEANIA; IT IS A  PLACE WHERE CHARACTERS RESIDE IN BUILDINGS SHAPED LIKE PINEAPPLES,  EASTER ISLAND STATUES, AND TIKIS AND ARE SURROUNDED BY HAWAIIAN-SHIRT  MOTIFS AND STEEL-GUITAR MUSIC.2 THIS CULTURAL APPROPRIATION OF ICONIC  PACIFIC ISLAND REPRESENTATIONS IS NOT A NEW PRACTICE, AS CAN BE SEEN  ACROSS EVERY FACET OF GLOBAL POPULAR CULTURE, INCLUDING RESTAURANTS,  HOTELS, COCKTAILS, FILM, LITERATURE, AND VIDEO AND BOARD GAMES (BECK  2013). THESE PRACTICES ALLOW THE SPECIFICITIES OF PACIFIC ISLANDERS TO  GO UNMARKED AND UNADDRESSED (TEAIWA 2010; DIAZ 2002), REDUCING THE  CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF OCEANIA TO SYMBOLS OF TOURIST ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE  ISLANDS (KAHN 2011). NATIVE HAWAIIAN FILMMAKER ANNE KEALA KELLY CALLED  THE REMOVAL OF PACIFIC ISLANDERS FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR OWN  CULTURES “THE NARRATIVE EQUIVALENT OF ETHNIC CLEANSING,” IN WHICH PEOPLE  GET ERASED FROM THEIR OWN STORYLINES (QUOTED IN HERRERIA 2017). THIS  ERASURE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR OWN STORYLINES IS EVIDENT IN THE CASE  OF BIKINI ATOLL. THE VIOLENCES AGAINST BIKINIANS ARE NOT COMMON  KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF OCEANIA, AS THE WORLD’S COLLECTIVE STORIES AND  HISTORIES ABOUT WORLD WAR II AND ITS AFTERMATH IN OCEANIA FREQUENTLY  FOCUS ON THE ENGAGEMENTS OF MILITARY POWERS AT PLACES LIKE PEARL HARBOR,  NAGASAKI, AND HIROSHIMA BUT FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXPERIENCES OF  PACIFIC ISLANDERS LIKE THE BIKINIANS (SEE CAMACHO 2011).  348 THE  CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) THE VIOLENT APPROPRIATION OF BIKINI  DURING WORLD WAR II, US TROOPS ENGAGED IN PROTRACTED COMBAT TO EXPUNGE  JAPANESE SOLDIERS FROM THE MARSHALL ISLANDS (CAMACHO 2011; FALGOUT,  POYER, AND CARUCCI 2008) AND, WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT OF  MARSHALLESE SCOUTS, DEFEATED JAPANESE FORCES. LIKE JAPAN, THE UNITED  STATES RECOGNIZED THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF AN OUTPOST IN THE NORTHERN  PACIFIC OCEAN, WEST OF HAWAI‘I AND EAST OF ASIA. IN THE REORDERING OF  WORLD GOVERNANCE THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER THE WAR, THE US GOVERNMENT  CONVINCED THE UNITED NATIONS TO GIVE IT ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY FOR AN  AREA THAT COLONIAL POWERS CARVED OUT OF OCEANIA AND DESIGNATED AS  MICRONESIA,3 INCLUDING THE MARSHALL ISLANDS. WITH THE BLESSING OF THE  UNITED NATIONS, US SETTLER COLONIALISM BEGAN (WOLFE 2006; VERACINI  2010). AMERICAN SETTLERS—PRIMARILY MILITARY BUT ALSO NON-MILITARY  GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS AND THEIR FAMILIES (DVORAK 2018)—LAID CLAIM TO  THE MARSHALL ISLANDS AS TRANSIENT, BUT CONSISTENTLY AGGRESSIVE,  INFLUENCES ON THE ISLANDS. THE US GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THE STRUCTURES  OF SETTLER COLONIALISM, AS DESCRIBED BY J KĒHAULANI KAUANUI (2016),  THROUGH A PERMANENT BASE ON KWAJALEIN ATOLL, TODAY KNOWN AS THE RONALD  REAGAN BALLISTIC MISSILE TEST SITE, WHERE IT DESTROYS, ERASES, AND  REPLACES MARSHALLESE RENDERINGS OF PLACE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF  INSTITUTIONS, NAMES, AND PRACTICES THAT PRIVILEGE COLONIAL OBJECTIVES.  MILITARY LEADERS AND THEIR FAMILIES COME AND GO ON KWAJALEIN, BUT FROM  THE BASE, THEY COORDINATE AND MAINTAIN CONTROL OF MARSHALLESE LAND, AIR,  AND SEA TO ENACT US MILITARY OBJECTIVES.4 ONCE ESTABLISHED ON  KWAJALEIN, THE US GOVERNMENT UNFOLDED ITS PLANS FOR COLD WAR NUCLEAR  WEAPONS EXPERIMENTATION IN THE ISLANDS. AS A FORM OF SETTLER  COLONIALISM, IN WHICH IMPERIAL POWERS SETTLE INTO NEW LOCATIONS TO ENACT  DOMINANCE (WOLFE 2006), THE PREDATORY, NUCLEAR, AND MILITARY  COLONIALISM SPREAD ITS VIOLENCE TO BIKINI, ENEWETAK, AND OTHER  COMMUNITIES. THE US GOVERNMENT REMOVED THE PEOPLE OF BIKINI AND ENEWETAK  ATOLLS FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL ISLANDS TO CONDUCT TOP-SECRET MILITARY  DETONATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS, DOCUMENTING THE HUMAN AND BIOLOGICAL  IMPACTS OF RADIATION EXPOSURE (BARKER 2013; JOHNSON 2013; HOROWITZ 2011;  JOHNSTON AND BARKER 2008; NIEDENTHAL 2001). BIKINI, THE FIRST SITE  CHOSEN BY THE US NAVY AS A GROUND ZERO FOR WEAPONS TESTING, BECAME A  GLOBAL PHENOMENON LONG BEFORE SPONGEBOB. FRENCH DESIGNERS OF NEW  POST–WORLD WAR II SWIMWEAR REGALED THE SPLITTING OF THE BATHING SUIT  INTO TWO PIECES, SIMILAR TO WHAT SCIENTISTS DID WITH THE ATOM TO PROVIDE  ENERGY FOR THE ATOMIC DETONATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE ON BIKINI  BARKER •  UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 349 (BARKER 2015). AT THE TIME, THE BIKINI  REFLECTED THE WESTERN WORLD’S ABILITY TO RESUME LEISURE ACTIVITIES, SUCH  AS SPENDING TIME AT THE BEACH, AND ITS POST–WORLD WAR II LOVE AFFAIR  WITH THE WEAPON CREDITED WITH DEFEATING THE JAPANESE. THE FRIVOLITY  ASSOCIATED WITH THE BIKINI CERTAINLY DOES NOT CHARACTERIZE THE FIRSTHAND  EXPERIENCES OF THE JAPANESE AND MARSHALLESE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE  GENOCIDAL NATURE OF THESE WEAPONS DESIGNED FOR MASS DESTRUCTION. THE  BIKINI EMERGED FROM A TWELVE-YEAR FIREWORK DISPLAY OF US MILITARY  SUPERIORITY ABOVE, BELOW, AND ON BIKINI AND ENEWETAK ATOLLS—ALL OF THE  DOMAINS THAT MAKE UP THE MARSHALLESE NOTION OF PLACE. THE UNITED STATES  DETONATED SIXTY-SEVEN NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS FROM  1946–1958, INCLUDING THE 1 MARCH 1954 BRAVO DETONATION ON BIKINI ATOLL, A  THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSION THAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE THOUSAND  HIROSHIMA-SIZED BOMBS. THE BIKINI THUS BECAME THE FIRST GLOBAL  DISASSOCIATION OF BIKINI FROM THIS VIOLENCE: IT DEFLECTED GAZES FROM THE  VAPORIZING OF ENTIRE ISLANDS AND THE BANISHING OF COUNTLESS GENERATIONS  OF BIKINIANS FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL HOME. IN A SIMILAR WAY, SPONGEBOB  SHIFTS VIEWERS’ CONTEMPORARY GAZE FROM THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON  THE SURFACE OF THE ISLANDS, OR THE BIKINI TOP, TO BIKINI BOTTOM, THE  LOWER PORTION OF THE BATHING SUIT, OR THE PROVERBIAL BACKSIDE. THE  SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE OF SPONGEBOB’S SETTING IN A PLACE CALLED “BIKINI  BOTTOM” THREATENS TO ERASE THE CULTURAL MEANING OF THE SURFACE OF THE  COCONUT TO THE MARSHALLESE. “BIKINI” IS THE ANGLICIZED WORD FOR  “PIKINNI,” OR “SURFACE OF THE COCONUT,” IN MARSHALLESE (“PIK” MEANS  “SURFACE” AND “NI” MEANS “COCONUT”),5 AND MARSHALLESE CULTURE, LIKE  OTHER OCEANIAN CULTURES, PLACES GREAT VALUE ON THIS PART OF THE COCONUT.  WHILE A TOURIST ENCOUNTERING A COCONUT WHILE ON VACATION OR EVEN IN A  GROCERY STORE MIGHT THINK OF THE SURFACE OF THE COCONUT AS UNIMPORTANT  AND DISPENSABLE, FOR THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE, THE HAIR ATTACHED TO THE OUTER  PART OF THE COCONUT IS A BUILDING BLOCK FOR A COMMUNITY, NOT A  DISPOSABLE ITEM. MARSHALLESE HAVE TRADITIONALLY ROLLED THAT HAIR INTO  THE SENNIT THAT HOISTS AND HOLDS THE SAILS AND BINDS THE HULLS OF  CANOES, ALLOWING SOME OF THE BEST NAVIGATORS IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE  BIKINIANS, TO NAVIGATE ANCIENT OCEANIC PATHWAYS BY READING MINUTE,  BARELY PERCEPTIBLE WAVE PATTERNS (SEE GENZ 2018; GENZ AND OTHERS 2009).  THE SENNIT ALSO HUGS TOGETHER THE MATERIALS FOR CULTURAL FORTITUDE, SUCH  AS BUILDINGS, TOOLS, DANCE IMPLEMENTS, AND CLOTHING. THE SURFACE OF THE  COCONUT IS ESSENTIAL TO A RESILIENT MARSHALLESE CULTURE THAT CONTINUES  TO THRIVE TODAY DESPITE FOUR CENTURIES OF COLONIAL ONSLAUGHT, INCLUDING  TWELVE YEARS OF MILITARY EXPERIMENTATION TO PERFECT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  THERE IS NO  350 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) GREATER  TESTIMONY TO THE RESILIENCE AND FORTITUDE OF THE MARSHALLESE THAN THE  ABILITY TO ENDURE REPEATEDLY A WEAPON OF MASS GENOCIDE—A DEVICE WITH THE  POTENTIAL TO EXTINGUISH ALL LIFE ON THIS PLANET. WEAPONS OF MASS  DESTRUCTION CANNOT MAKE THE MARSHALLESE DISAPPEAR, NOR CAN SPONGEBOB.  HOW IS THIS HISTORY OF NUCLEAR TESTING INCORPORATED INTO SPONGEBOB  SQUAREPANTS? ONLINE DISCUSSIONS OF FAN THEORIES ABOUND REGARDING THE  “TRUE MEANING” OF SPONGEBOB (FRANCISDOLLARHYDE 2012; BRADLEY 2015). FOR  EXAMPLE, THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THE SEVEN MAJOR CHARACTERS OF THE  SHOW REPRESENT THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS: THE AMOROUS SPONGEBOB REPRESENTS  LUST; KRUSTY KRAB, THE MONEY-LOVING OWNER OF A HAMBURGER JOINT,  PERSONIFIES GREED; AND PATRICK STAR, THE LARGE, PINK SEA STAR, EMBODIES  SLOTH. ANOTHER POPULAR THEORY—ONE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THIS  ARTICLE—SUGGESTS THAT THE CHARACTERS IN THE SHOW ARE MALFORMED AND  BIZARRE BECAUSE THEY ARE MUTANTS EXPOSED TO RADIATION FROM THE ATOMIC  DETONATIONS AT BIKINI, AND CHARACTERS LIKE SANDY CHEEKS THE SQUIRREL DON  DIVING SUITS AND MASKS TO STAY SAFE FROM THE RADIATION. THIS SECOND FAN  THEORY IS NOT FARFETCHED, GIVEN THE INSERTION OF LIVEACTION FOOTAGE OF  DETONATIONS AT BIKINI ATOLL INTO THE FRANCHISE’S TELEVISION PROGRAMS AND  MOVIES. HOWEVER, THE POINT OF THIS ARTICLE IS NOT TO SUPPORT FAN  THEORIES OR TO EXPOSE THE INTENTIONALITY OF THE SHOW’S CREATOR.  REGARDLESS OF HILLENBURG’S ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS FOR THE CARTOON,  SPONGEBOB’S SQUATTER EXISTENCE AT BIKINI ENABLES A POWERFUL MEDIA  INFLUENCE TO LAY CLAIM TO AND SETTLE INTO MARSHALLESE LANDS. SPONGEBOB’S  ASSERTION OF RESIDENCE AS PART OF FICTIONAL ENTERTAINMENT SUGGESTS THAT  THE UNITED STATES’ TAKING OF OCEANIAN LAND IS NATURAL AND EVEN COMICAL.  THE REAL-LIFE STORY OF BIKINI EVOKES TEARS AND ANGER FROM THE PEOPLE  WHO FAIL TO COME INTO FOCUS IN SPONGEBOB’S STORYLINE, IN WHICH THE  FICTIONAL BIKINI BOTTOM SERVES AS A MIRAGE THAT CLOUDS VIEWERS’ ABILITY  TO SEE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE NONFICTION REALITY. KELLY OPINED ABOUT THIS  KIND OF DISASSOCIATION CREATED BY THE MEDIA: “THE TOUGH PART IS THAT  MOST PEOPLE WOULD GIVE A DAMN. MOST PEOPLE WOULD CARE IF THEY HEARD THE  TRUTH. MOST PEOPLE DO CARE ABOUT JUSTICE, . . . BUT THEY’RE BEING  ENTERTAINED INTO NOT CARING ABOUT IT” (QUOTED IN HERRERIA 2017). IN THIS  REGARD, BY SEPARATING THE HUMAN TRAGEDIES OF BIKINI FROM THE ATOLL’S  MEDIA REPRESENTATION, SPONGEBOB DIMINISHES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE  VIEWER EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THE BIKINIANS.   BARKER • UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 351 ALTHOUGH THE US GOVERNMENT REMOVED THE  PEOPLE OF BIKINI FROM THE ATOLL ABOVE THE SURFACE, THIS DOES NOT GIVE  LICENSE TO SPONGEBOB OR ANYONE ELSE, FICTITIOUS OR OTHERWISE, TO OCCUPY  BIKINI. SPONGEBOB’S PRESENCE ON BIKINI BOTTOM CONTINUES THE VIOLENT AND  RACIST EXPULSION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES FROM THEIR LANDS (AND IN THIS  CASE THEIR COSMOS) THAT ENABLES US HEGEMONIC POWERS TO EXTEND THEIR  MILITARY AND COLONIAL INTERESTS IN THE POSTWAR ERA. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO  DISMANTLE HIERARCHIES OF OPPRESSION, INCLUDING IN ITS POPULAR CULTURE  FORMS, IT IS NECESSARY TO AMPLIFY MARSHALLESE NOTIONS OF LAND.  MARSHALLESE INSISTENCE ON AN INTERCONNECTED NOTION OF “LAND” THE  EVERYDAY RHYTHMS OF LIFE ON CORAL ATOLLS UNDERSCORE A MARSHALLESE VISION  OF INTERCONNECTED DOMAINS, INCLUDING AREAS BELOW THE SEA. LIKE MARINE  BIOLOGISTS OBSERVING, GAINING KNOWLEDGE OF, AND ACTING ON THEORIES ABOUT  SEA-BASED LIFE, THE MARSHALLESE ENVISION THE DOMAINS OF SKY, LAND, AND  SEA, INCLUDING AREAS BELOW THE SEA, AS INTERTWINED; THEY RECOGNIZE THAT  THEIR LIVES ON THE SURFACE OF THE ISLANDS ARE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE  SKELETONS OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES GROWING ON TOP OF SUBMERGED VOLCANOES.  THE LAGOON, WITH ITS QUIET WATERS SURROUNDED BY A RING OF ISLANDS, IS  AT THE HEART OF MARSHALLESE COMMUNITY LIFE. GIVEN MARSHALLESE WORLDVIEWS  AND NOTIONS OF THE LAND, SEA, AND SKY AS INTERRELATED AND SYMBIOTIC, IT  IS HARDLY SURPRISING THAT MARSHALLESE MYTHOLOGY, LIKE STORIES FROM  ACROSS OCEANIA, TELL OF FISHERMEN WHO SNAG GIANT ISLANDS FROM BELOW THE  SURFACE, PULLING THEM ABOVE THE WATER SO THAT HUMANS CAN CREATE THEIR  HOMES. NUMEROUS MARSHALLESE ORIGIN STORIES EXIST THAT DESCRIBE THE  EMERGENCE OF BOTH HUMANS AND DEITIES FROM THE HEAVENS AND THE SEAS  (TOBIN 2002), SUCH AS THE LEGEND OF WULLEP, THE FIRST DEITY WHO EMERGED  FROM A GIANT CLAMSHELL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN (ERDLAND 1914,  310–311). THE INTERCONNECTIVITY OF THE MARSHALLESE WORLD IS PARAMOUNT IN  THE ATOLL ENVIRONMENT THAT SPONGEBOB TRIES TO PARCEL INTO DISTINCT  SECTIONS. THE TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE INTERWEAVING IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT  OF THE LEGEND OF ĀJINKŌJ EO (THE GIFTS), FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1976 DURING  US OCCUPATION OF THE ISLANDS.6 IN THE STORY, FISHERMEN SEARCH FOR FOOD  TO FEED THE HUNGRY PEOPLE, ULTIMATELY PULLING IN A GIANT ISLAND FILLED  WITH FOOD-BEARING TREES— LITERALLY GIFTS THAT EMERGE FROM BENEATH THE  SEAS. THE STORY, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATION BY MARSHALLESE  ARTIST ISO LA¯NINBELIK (GIDEON 2011, 95; SEE FIGURE 1), REINFORCES AN  INSISTENCE ON REAFFIRMING A MAR- FIGURE 1 ARTWORK BY ISO LA¯NINBELIK  DEPICTING MARSHALLESE STORIES ABOUT THE ISLANDS AND TERRESTRIAL LIFE  EMERGING FROM THE SEA. REPRODUCED WITH PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL  SERVICES CENTER, MARSHALL ISLANDS MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.  BARKER •  UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 353 SHALLESE WORLDVIEW THAT EMPHASIZES THE  INTERCONNECTIVITY THAT SPONGEBOB BIFURCATES. THE CONCEPT OF “LAND” IS A  WESTERN CONSTRUCTION THAT DOES NOT EQUATE WITH A TRADITIONAL MARSHALLESE  WORLDVIEW; ONE’S LAND IS NOT SIMPLY DRY ACREAGE TO STAND ON, AND IT  CERTAINLY IS NOT A COMMODITY THAT ANY ONE PERSON OR GENERATION CAN OWN  (JOHNSTON AND BARKER 2008). THE MARSHALLESE CALL THEIR WORLD—AGAIN, NOT  JUST THE LAND—“AELŌ¯N KEIN AD,” FREQUENTLY TRANSLATED AS “THESE ISLANDS  OF OURS.” SOMETIMES MARSHALLESE REFER TO THEIR NATION, THE MARSHALL  ISLANDS, AS “AELŌ¯N IN MAJOL,” A VESTIGE OF COLONIAL NAMING PRACTICES  HONORING THE INITIAL “DISCOVERER” OF THE LOCATION, BRITISH CAPTAIN JOHN  MARSHALL. DESPITE THE SIMILARITIES IN SOUND, “ISLAND” IS NOT A  TRANSLATION FOR “AELŌ¯N” (PRONOUNCED LONG-I SOUND + LUHNG); THE WORD  “ISLAND” FOCUSES ON THE TERRESTRIAL REALM ABOVE THE OCEAN AND DOES NOT  CAPTURE THE EXPANSIVE MARSHALLESE VERSION OF PLACE EMBODIED IN “AELŌ¯N,”  IN WHICH “AE” REFERS TO THE CURRENTS OR THE SEAS AND “LŌ¯N” TO THE  HEAVENS OR THE SKIES ABOVE (AHLGREN 2016). AS THE CONCEPT OF AELŌ¯N  COMMUNICATES, THERE IS NO SEPARATION OF REALMS BECAUSE MARSHALLESE  NOTIONS OF LAND ARE EXPANSIVE AND HOLISTIC, EXTENDING TO THE BOTTOM OF  THE OCEAN AND LAGOONS, AS FAR AS THE OCEAN CURRENTS FLOW, AND AS HIGH AS  THE STARS AND HEAVENS.7 IN ADDITION TO THE VOLCANOES THAT SUPPORT CORAL  AND HUMAN LIFE, ATOLLS THROUGHOUT THE MARSHALL ISLANDS INCLUDE  PROMINENT SEAMOUNTS, OR UNDERWATER MOUNTAINS THAT ARE ROOTED TO THE  SEAFLOOR AND DO NOT REACH THE SURFACE. THERE ARE FORTY-THREE SEAMOUNTS  IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, WHICH HAVE PROPER NAMES IDENTIFYING THEM AS  IMPORTANT CULTURAL FEATURES THAT CONNECT TO THE DAILY LIVES OF PEOPLE ON  THE SURFACE (JOHNSTON AND BARKER 2008, 69). AT BIKINI, AS WITH EVERY  ATOLL OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL COSMOS MAINTAINS THE  RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAGOON, LAND, AND AIR. BIKINI ATOLL COMPRISES THE  SKIES ABOVE, THE SEAS AND CURRENTS AROUND, AND THE VOLCANOES AND LAGOON  BELOW, INCLUDING BIKINI BOTTOM, WHERE THE COLONIAL SQUATTER SPONGEBOB  AND HIS FRIENDS RESIDE. UNLIKE IN THE CARTOON, THE BOTTOM OF THE LAGOON  REMAINS ACTIVELY JOINED WITH MARSHALLESE DAILY LIFE ON THE SURFACE, AS  IS EVIDENT IN THE LANGUAGE, MYTHOLOGY, AND LA¯NINBELIK’S ARTWORK. SONGS  AND PLACE SONG IS ANOTHER MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH MARSHALLESE ASSERTIONS OF  THEIR OWN HISTORY AND MEMORIES OF PLACE CHALLENGE ANY EFFORTS TO USURP  PEOPLE FROM THEIR LANDS. IMAGINE THE SILENCE THAT WOULD EMERGE FROM  ASKING A  354 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) ROOM FULL OF YOUNG  PEOPLE TO DISCUSS THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT US ACTIVITIES ON BIKINI ATOLL.  NOW IMAGINE THE VOLUMINOUS RESPONSE YOU MIGHT RECEIVE TO THE LEAD  QUESTION IN THE SPONGEBOB THEME SONG: “WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER  THE SEA?” (WALLER 2010). THIS DISCREPANCY SHOULD BE UNSETTLING TO  EVERYONE. IN THE THEME SONG, THE SONGWRITERS, INCLUDING HILLENBURG, ASK  KIDS IF THEY ARE READY TO SING ALONG, OR, PUT ANOTHER WAY, TO JOIN THE  COMMUNITY OF SPONGEBOB FANS. THE FIRST ACT OF THE SONG IS TO HAVE  CHILDREN IDENTIFY WHO RESIDES IN THE PINEAPPLE HOUSE. THE CHILDREN’S  RESPONSE, REPEATED EXTENSIVELY THROUGHOUT THE SONG, AFFIRMS THAT THE  HOUSE AND BIKINI BOTTOM ARE THE DOMAIN OF SPONGEBOB. THE SONG’S  DIRECTIVES, ENSCONCED IN HUMOR, PROVIDE THE VIEWER WITH AN ACTIVE ROLE  IN DEFINING BIKINI BOTTOM AS A PLACE OF NONSENSE, AS THE AUDIENCE IS  INSTRUCTED, “IF NAUTICAL NONSENSE BE SOMETHING YOU WISH . . . DROP ON  THE DECK AND FLOP LIKE A FISH” (WALLER 2010). THE VIEWER BECOMES AN  UNWITTING PARTICIPANT IN THE CO-OPTING OF BIKINI’S STORY AND THE  EXCLUSION OF THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE FROM THE POSTWAR DISCOURSES THAT DIAZ  ILLUMINATED (2001). IT IS IMPLAUSIBLE THAT HILLENBURG AND NICKELODEON,  THE CARTOON’S NETWORK, ENVISIONED AN ACT OF US COLONIALISM AS THEY  DEVELOPED THE SHOW, BUT IT IS DISTURBING THAT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THEM  THAT BIKINI BOTTOM AND BIKINI ATOLL WERE NOT THEIRS FOR THE TAKING.  SINCE MILLIONS OF VIEWERS WORLDWIDE HEAR ABOUT BIKINI BOTTOM THROUGH  SPONGEBOB WITHOUT BEING OFFERED A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT BIKINI  ATOLL OR ITS PEOPLE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER HOW THE SHOW SHAPES  VIEWERS’ WORLDVIEWS, IDEOLOGIES, AND UNDERSTANDINGS. AS CRITICAL MEDIA  SCHOLAR STUART HALL NOTED: “IN MODERN SOCIETIES, THE DIFFERENT MEDIA ARE  ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SITES FOR THE PRODUCTION, REPRODUCTION, AND  TRANSFORMATION OF IDEOLOGIES. . . . INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE MEDIA ARE . . .  PART OF THE DOMINANT MEANS OF IDEOLOGICAL PRODUCTION. WHAT THEY  ‘PRODUCE’ IS, PRECISELY, REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SOCIAL WORLD, IMAGES,  DESCRIPTIONS, EXPLANATIONS AND FRAMES FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW THE WORLD IS  AND WHY IT WORKS AS IT IS SAID” (2003, 90). IN LINE WITH HALL’S IDEAS,  MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WHO VIEW THE SHOW BECOME ACCULTURATED TO AN  IDEOLOGY THAT INCLUDES THE US CHARACTER SPONGEBOB RESIDING ON ANOTHER  PEOPLE’S HOMELAND AS A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW OUR WORLD OPERATES. A  COLONIALISM THAT SETTLES SPONGEBOB AND HIS FRIENDS INTO BIKINI BOTTOM IS  THUS PRODUCED, REPRODUCED, AND NORMALIZED THROUGH THE CARTOON SERIES.  THE SPONGEBOB THEME SONG STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE SONG “BIKINIAN  ANTHEM,” WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN 1946 BY A MEMBER OF THE BIKINI COMMUNITY,  LORE KESSIBUKI. IT EXPRESSES KESSIBUKI’S “OVERWHELMING” FEELING  BARKER •  UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 355 AND “GREAT DESPAIR” OF BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM  HIS HOME ISLANDS AS AN IMMENSE POWER DESTROYS THE TRANQUILITY OF LIFE ON  BIKINI. THE SONG REMAINS A STAPLE AT ANNUAL COMMEMORATIONS OF THE  NUCLEAR LEGACY ON THE 1 MARCH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRAVO DETONATION,  REAFFIRMING THE MEMORIES AND HISTORY IN MARSHALLESE TERMS AND OFTEN  ACCOMPANYING A MULTITUDE OF TEARS. THE ANTHEM IS SUNG IN MARSHALLESE  GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS; ON THE ISLANDS OF KILI, EJIT, AND MAJURO, WHERE  THE COMMUNITY RESIDES; AND IN FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS, SALEM, OREGON,  ENID, OKLAHOMA, AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THE  COMMUNITY’S FRAGMENTATION AND MIGRATION SERVE AS CONSTANT REMINDERS OF  THE VIOLENT SEPARATION OF THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR LAND. ALL OF THIS IS  EMBODIED IN THE SONG: BIKINIAN ANTHEM NO LONGER CAN I STAY; IT’S TRUE.  NO LONGER CAN I LIVE IN PEACE AND HARMONY. NO LONGER CAN I REST ON MY  SLEEPING MAT AND PILLOW BECAUSE OF MY ISLAND AND THE LIFE I ONCE KNEW  THERE. THE THOUGHT IS OVERWHELMING RENDERING ME HELPLESS AND IN GREAT  DESPAIR. MY SPIRIT LEAVES, DRIFTING AROUND AND FAR AWAY WHERE IT BECOMES  CAUGHT IN A CURRENT OF IMMENSE POWER— AND ONLY THEN DO I FIND  TRANQUILITY. (QUOTED AND TRANSLATED IN NIEDENTHAL 2001) KESSIBUKI’S  CREATION EMOTES AND DOCUMENTS THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE’S HARDSHIPS AND  STRONGLY REFUTES ANY AMERICAN HEGEMONIC EFFORTS TO ERASE OR CLEANSE THE  ATOLL OF US SINS. FOR KESSIBUKI AND THE BIKINIANS WHO HAVE CONTINUED TO  SING THE ANTHEM SINCE HIS DEATH, LEAVING BIKINI WAS AKIN TO RIPPING THE  SOUL OF THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR BODIES, AS THEIR ISLANDS AND THE LIFE THEY  ONCE KNEW WERE GONE. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH JACK NIEDENTHAL, KESSIBUKI  RECALLED HIS MOTIVATION TO COMPOSE THE SONG, WHICH CAME ON AN EXTREMELY  CHALLENGING DAY FOR THE BIKINIANS, WHO WERE EXPERIENCING NEAR STARVATION  AFTER THEIR FORCED RELOCATION FROM BIKINI: I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT ONE  DAY MANY OF OUR PEOPLE WERE WALKING AROUND VOMITING, AND HAVING A  TERRIBLE TIME WITH THEIR STOMACHS, BECAUSE THEY HAD FORCED THEMSELVES TO  EAT A LOT OF THE POISONED FISH. THESE FISH WERE THE ONLY AVAILABLE FOOD  FOR US TO EAT AT THE TIME. IT WAS MID-AFTERNOON AND EXTREMELY HOT WHEN I  MYSELF FELT NAUSEATED AND I SLOWLY SLUMPED TO THE GROUND BENEATH A  COCONUT TREE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, A BURST OF IMAGES RUSHED INTO MY MIND  ABOUT BIKINI. I RECALLED THE MEMORIES OF WHAT WONDERFUL LIVES WE HAD  LIVED WHEN WE WERE ON OUR ISLANDS. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I BEGAN TO  COMPOSE A VISION IN  356 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) MY SOUL  ABOUT MY HOMELAND—BIKINI, BIKINI, BIKINI, BIKINI—THE DREAM WAS SO  BEAUTIFUL: I REMEMBERED THE ENDLESS, WHITE BEACHES WHERE I USED TO TAKE  LONG WALKS WITH THE SANDS RISING UP BETWEEN MY TOES; AND I THOUGHT ABOUT  THE LUSH JUNGLES THAT HAD PROVIDED ME WITH COUNTLESS ADVENTURES AS A  CHILD; AND I TASTED THE DELICIOUS FISH THAT COULD BE EASILY CAUGHT—EVEN  BY A SMALL CHILD—IN THE LAGOON; AND I IMAGINED MYSELF TOUCHING THE  TOMBSTONES IN THE GRAVEYARD OF THE ELDERS; AND I ENVISIONED MYSELF  SAILING ACROSS THE LAGOON IN A CANOE WHICH WAS LOADED DOWN WITH FRESH  TUNA; AND I RECALLED HOW I USED TO TALK WITH MY FAMILY, PEACEFULLY AND  QUIETLY, LONG INTO THE NIGHT. THESE RECOLLECTIONS CAUSED ME, WHEN  COUPLED WITH MY WEAKENED STATE, TO BECOME QUICKLY, AND EMBARRASSINGLY,  REDUCED TO TEARS RIGHT THERE UNDER THE TREE—IN THE DAYTIME! I WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE A LEADER, YET, I WAS CRUMBLING, CRYING. MY GOD, I  THOUGHT, WAS I LOSING MY MIND? THAT WAS WHEN I BEGAN TO CONSTRUCT A  POWERFUL SONG THAT SEEMED TO FLOW OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF MY BEING. MY  MOUTH FELT LIKE IT WAS UTTERING THE WORDS ON ITS OWN, AS IF THEY WERE  COMING FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE. (QUOTED IN NIEDENTHAL 2001, 137–138) THE  NUCLEAR SONGS OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS COMMUNICATE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE  IN MANY WAYS BEYOND COMPREHENSION (SCHWARTZ 2012). WHEN THE BIKINIANS  SING THEIR ANTHEM AS A COLLECTIVE, THEY CALL ATTENTION TO THE PROFOUND  PAINS OF NUCLEAR COLONIALISM THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED INVISIBLE THROUGH  GLOBAL DISCOURSE, INCLUDING THROUGH TELEVISION SHOWS LIKE SPONGEBOB,  THAT ERASES US VIOLENCE AND THE HARDSHIPS OF THE MARSHALLESE PEOPLE.  KESSIBUKI’S SONG MAKES THE INAUDIBLE AUDIBLE (SCHWARTZ 2012, 14). WHILE  SPONGEBOB GETS CHILDREN TO LAUGH AND IMAGINE WRIGGLING AROUND LIKE FISH,  CONTEMPORARY SINGING OF “BIKINIAN ANTHEM” ENSURES THAT THE HISTORIES  AND NARRATIVES OF THE COMMUNITY REMAIN FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN THE LIVES OF  THE MARSHALLESE PEOPLE. AT THE SAME TIME, SONGS LIKE THE ANTHEM GARNER  TEARS AND ARTICULATE THE CONTINUED TRAUMAS RESIDING IN THE COMMUNITY;  THEY CARRY THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE AS THEY ARE TAUGHT TO CHILDREN AND  PASSED TO SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF BIKINIANS AND MARSHALLESE. PEOPLE DO  NOT LAUGH AT THE SPONGEBOB THEME SONG AND CARTOON BECAUSE THEY ARE  MALICIOUS OR WILLING CONSPIRATORS TO COLONIAL ACTIVITIES. LIKE THE  BIKINI, THE PROGRAM OBFUSCATES THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY PAIN OF  THE BIKINIANS BY CLEANSING THEM FROM THEIR OWN STORY AND PLACE. HOWEVER,  IF THE LAUGHTER OF AUDIENCES IS NOT WRONG, THEN NEITHER ARE THE TEARS  OF THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE. WHAT SHOULD GIVE US PAUSE IS THE INFINITE GULF  BETWEEN THESE REACTIONS, A DISTANCE AS VAST AS THE COMFORT ZONE THE US  GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTED BETWEEN ITS WEAPONS-TESTING PROGRAM IN THE  MARSHALL ISLANDS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. EXCEPT FOR EXTREME FANS  EXPLORING CREATION THEO- BARKER • UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 357 RIES,  CONSUMERS OF SPONGEBOB DO NOT THINK ABOUT THE NONFICTIONAL BIKINI, AND  ONLINE FAN SITES DO NOT MENTION THE BIKINIANS OR THEIR EXPERIENCES.  LIKEWISE, IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS AND IN MARSHALLESE COMMUNITIES ACROSS  THE UNITED STATES, IT IS EXTREMELY RARE TO FIND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE  SHOW AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE PEOPLE’S HISTORY.8 GIVEN THE  HYPERVISIBILITY OF SPONGEBOB JUXTAPOSED AGAINST THE ALMOST INVISIBLE  EXISTENCE OF THE BIKINIANS, THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE EMPATHY AND  UNDERSTANDING IN THE CARTOON’S AUDIENCES AND TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE  HISTORY OF THE BIKINIANS’ ERASURE REMAINS UNTAPPED.9 HOWEVER,  EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS CAN ILLUMINATE BIKINIANS’ CONSTANT CONNECTION TO  THEIR HOMELAND, EVEN IN DIASPORA. THOUGH BIKINI IS UNPOPULATED BECAUSE  OF LINGERING RADIATION, IT IS FAR FROM A WASTELAND. THE LANGUAGE OF  WASTELANDING AND ERASURE IN SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS IN HER DOCUMENTATION  OF THE IMPACTS OF URANIUM MINING ON NAVAJO COMMUNITIES, TRACI BRYNNE  VOYLES DESCRIBED THE CONCEPT OF WASTELANDING, IN WHICH THE RACIALIZED  BODIES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BECOME REMOVABLE AND EXPENDABLE. LOCATIONS  SUCH AS BIKINI BOTTOM “ARE MARKED, PHYSICALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY, FOR  EXPLOITATION, RESOURCE EXTRACTIONS, AND NATIONAL SACRIFICE” AND  ULTIMATELY “RENDERED POLLUTABLE” (VOYLES 2015, 15). VOYLES’S DESCRIPTION  IS FITTING FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT TRANSPIRED ON BIKINI ATOLL, WHERE  THE US NAVY FRAMED A REQUEST FOR THE PEOPLE TO VACATE THEIR ISLANDS AS  BEING “FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND.” THE UNITED STATES PRESENTED CONCEPTS OF  NUCLEAR DETERRENCE TO THE MARSHALLESE AND ASKED THE BIKINIANS TO PLAY  THEIR PART SO THAT THE UNITED STATES COULD CULTIVATE A WEAPON THAT WOULD  PRODUCE WORLD PEACE (WEISGALL 1994; NIEDENTHAL 2012; BARKER 2013;  HOROWITZ 2011).10 ANTHROPOLOGISTS LAURA NADER AND HUGH GUSTERSON  IDENTIFIED THE EXTERNALIZATION OF HARMS AS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF  NUCLEARITY, OR THE IMPERIAL CONTROL OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY TO MAXIMIZE  POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY BENEFITS FOR COLONIAL POWERS (2007).  BY EXTERNALIZING THE VIOLENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, COLONIAL POWERS DEPLOY  DEVICES OF GENOCIDE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SEEM UNIMAGINABLE WHEN  CONSIDERING THE GOOD OF HUMANKIND (NADER AND GUSTERSON 2007). IN THE  CASE OF THE MARSHALLESE, THE US GOVERNMENT SECURED ALL THE BENEFITS OF  NUCLEARITY, INCLUDING MILITARY DOMINANCE, COLD WAR POLITICAL POWER, AND  SCIENTIFIC AND MILITARY ADVANCEMENT. THE MARSHALLESE, HOWEVER,  EXPERIENCED THE OPPOSITE OF WORLD PEACE, AS PEOPLE HAD THEIR BODIES,  CULTURE, ECONOMY, AND LANDS RAVAGED BY THE WEAPONS-TESTING ACTIVITIES  (JOHNSTON 1994; BARKER 2013). 358 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019)  SPONGEBOB CONTRIBUTES TO THE WASTELANDING OF BIKINI ATOLL THROUGH A  MULTIMODAL CONSTRUCTION OF IDEOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE DISCOURSE, MUSIC,  VISUALS, AND DEPICTIONS THAT OPERATE SYNERGISTICALLY TO CONSTRUCT  MEANING ABOUT BIKINI BOTTOM AND THOSE WHO INHABIT IT.11 A FAN PAGE  DEVOTED TO THE SHOW REVEALS HOW THE PUBLIC ASSIGNS MEANING TO SPONGEBOB,  INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS OF THE MARSHALLESE AS PRIMITIVE AND EXTINCT,  AS EVIDENT IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT AN EPISODE DEPICTING ANCIENT SEA CAVES  CONTAINING RUDIMENTARY DRAWINGS, “PROBABLY DRAWN BY PREHISTORIC BIKINI  BOTTOM CITIZENS” (ENCYCLOPEDIA SPONGEBOBIA 2017). THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE  LIVED ON THAT ATOLL AND LAGOON FOR CENTURIES BEFORE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY  AND BODIES BECAME EXPENDABLE TO US MILITARY AND POLITICAL INTERESTS, BUT  AS DIAZ NOTED (2001), THE TENACIOUS RESILIENCE OF OCEANIAN HISTORY AND  CULTURE REMAIN AFFIXED TO THE DISCOURSE EVEN WHEN THESE RENDERINGS ARE  FAINT REFERENCES TO A PREVIOUS LIFE REFLECTED IN SEA-CAVE DRAWINGS. THE  CHARACTERS WHO MOVED TO BIKINI BOTTOM AFTER THE BIKINIANS HAD BEEN  REMOVED BY THE UNITED STATES SURF AND SWIM AT GOO LAGOON, A PLACE MADE  OF A “STRANGE GOO” (ENCYCLOPEDIA SPONGEBOBIA 2017). IN NONFICTION,  PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE POSTWAR ERA SHOW US SERVICEMEN ENJOYING THE BEAUTY  OF BIKINI ATOLL BEFORE IT BECAME TOO CONTAMINATED WITH THE RADIOACTIVE  MATERIALS, OR STRANGE GOO, THAT RENDER IT UNSAFE FOR HUMAN HABITATION  TODAY. IN HER POEM “HISTORY PROJECT,” MARSHALLESE POET KATHY  JET¯NIL-KIJINER ARTICULATED THE DEVASTATING EMOTIONS AND REALITIES  CLINGING TO THE BACKGROUND OF AMERICAN ENGAGEMENT IN THE ISLANDS. AS  KESSIBUKI DID DECADES BEFORE, JET¯NIL-KIJINER DESCRIBED HER REACTION TO  PHOTOGRAPHS SHE ENCOUNTERED WHILE DOING RESEARCH FOR A NUCLEAR-THEMED  HISTORY PROJECT AS A TEENAGER: I FLIP THROUGH SNAPSHOTS OF AMERICAN  MARINES AND NURSES BRANDED WHITE WITH BLOATED GRINS SUCKING BEERS AND  TOSSING BEACH BALLS ALONG OUR SHORES AND MY ISLANDER ANCESTORS,  CROSS-LEGGED BEFORE A GENERAL LISTENING TO HIS FAIRY TALE ABOUT HOW IT’S  FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND TO HAND OVER OUR ISLANDS LET THEM BLAST  RADIOACTIVE ENERGY BARKER • UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 359 INTO OUR SLEEPY  COCONUT TREES OUR SAGGING BREADFRUIT TREES OUR BUSY FISHES THAT SPARKLE  LIKE NEW SUN INTO OUR CORAL REEFS BRILLIANT AS AN AURORA BOREALIS WOVEN  BENEATH A GLASS SEA GOD WILL THANK YOU THEY TOLD US (2017, 21).12 MOST  FRAMINGS OF AMERICAN HISTORY EXCLUDE THE BIKINIAN AND MARSHALLESE PEOPLE  SO EFFECTIVELY THAT THE BEACHES OF THE GROUND-ZERO LOCATIONS BECOME  VISIBLE ONLY AS PLAYGROUNDS FOR SERVICEMEN. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF  RADIATION FROM THE DETONATIONS, THE US DISCOURSE SHIFTS TO A PLACE OF  STRANGENESS AND WEIRDNESS, THE FABRIC OF SPONGEBOB. WHEN ASKED BY THE  HUFFINGTON POST WHAT FANS COULD EXPECT IN THE 2015 SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS  MOVIE, TOM KENNY, THE VOICE OF SPONGEBOB, REPLIED: “IT’S A MOVIE THAT  GOES OUT OF ITS WAY TO BE STRANGE AND WEIRD, WHICH IS WHAT I LOVE. YOU  KNOW, EVERYTHING I LOVED AS A KID WAS STRANGE AND WEIRD. EVERYTHING MY  KIDS LOVE, THEY TEND TO GO FOR THE STRANGE AND WEIRD” (QUOTED IN BRADLEY  2015). WHILE DESCRIBING A BOOK DESIGNED FOR SUPER FANS OF SPONGEBOB,  KENNY PURPOSEFULLY CONJURED BIKINI BOTTOM AS A PLACE OF WEIRDNESS AND  ODDNESS: “MUCH LIKE THIS BOOK YOU’RE HOLDING, THIS SQUAREPANTSIAN WORLD I  LIVE IN IS CHOCK-FULL OF ODD LITTLE POCKETS AND FLAPS WITH WEIRD STUFF  INSIDE THEM THAT I’M STILL DISCOVERING. . . . SO ON BEHALF OF TEAM  SPONGEBOB, WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS GLIMPSE INTO OUR SUBAQUATIC  ARCHIVES—THESE RARE BITS OF GRAPHIC FLOTSAM AND JETSAM DREDGED UP FROM  THE SUBCELLAR OF THE PINEAPPLE. IN TRUE BIKINI BOTTOM FASHION, THEY RUN  THE GAMUT FROM GORGEOUS TO GROTESQUE” (QUOTED IN BECK 2013, 9). THE  RENDERING OF BIKINI AS A PLACE NOT FITTING FOR HUMANS NORMALIZES THE  SITUATING OF STRANGE CHARACTERS BELOW THE SURFACE. KENNY CHOSE WORDS  SUCH AS “FLOTSAM” AND “JETSAM” TO DESCRIBE BIKINI BOTTOM, A PLACE WITH  DETRITUS CAST FROM SHIPS, OR THE PROVERBIAL WASTELAND IN VOYLES’S  THEORY. THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM IN SPONGEBOB, PRESUMABLY ITEMS LIKE THE  LIFE BUOY INSCRIBED WITH THE WORDS “BIKINI BOTTOM” PROMINENTLY FEATURED  IN THE SHOW, REFERENCE THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF LIFE ON BIKINI’S SURFACE.  THESE TERMS MIGHT ALSO APPLY TO THE SUNKEN SHIPS THAT APPEAR IN MANY  EPISODES, MUCH LIKE THE JAPANESE AND AMERICAN BOATS THAT LIE ON THE  LAGOON OF BIKINI TODAY—RELICS OF DETONATIONS TO TEST THE VULNERABILITY  OF NAVAL VESSELS TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS (WEISGALL 1994). 360 THE  CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 31:2 (2019) GLOBAL AUDIENCES HAVE THE PRIVILEGE  OF LAUGHING AT THE WEIRD, STRANGE, AND ODD WORLD OF BIKINI BECAUSE OF  ITS GEOGRAPHIC AND PERSONAL DISTANCE; THE UNITED STATES EXPORTED ITS  MOST DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES TO INDIGENOUS LANDS—THE MINING OF URANIUM ON  NAVAJO AND SPOKANE LAND, THE PROCESSING OF PLUTONIUM ON YAKAMA, NEZ  PERCE, AND UMATILLA LAND, AND THE TESTING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE LAND  BELONGING TO THE BIKINI AND ENEWETAK PEOPLE (BARKER 2015). SPONGEBOB  HAS THE PRIVILEGE, AS AN AMERICAN CHARACTER, OF NOT CARING ABOUT THE  DETONATION OF NUCLEAR BOMBS, AS NOTED BY ONE OF SPONGEBOB’S WRITERS, C H  GREENBLATT: “I WRITE SPONGEBOB AS INNOCENT, WITHOUT IRONY, SARCASM, OR  ULTERIOR MOTIVES. . . . THE WAY I LIKE TO APPROACH SPONGEBOB IS THAT HE  GETS EXCITED ABOUT THINGS THAT NOBODY GENERALLY GETS EXCITED ABOUT.  HERE’S A GUY WHO COULD GET SUPER-EXCITED ABOUT A NAPKIN BUT WOULDN’T  CARE IF THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OUTSIDE” (QUOTED IN BECK 2013, 30). THE  DETONATIONS DO NOT CAUSE CONCERN FOR THE CHARACTERS, AS THEY DID FOR THE  BIKINIANS, NOR DO THEY COMPROMISE SPONGEBOB’S FREQUENT ACTIVITIES, LIKE  VISITING HAMBURGER JOINTS OR THE BEACH WITH FRIENDS. DOUG LAWRENCE, THE  VOICE OF ANOTHER MAJOR CHARACTER, SHELDON J PLANKTON, SUGGESTED THAT  “SPONGEBOB IS A CHARACTER WHO REPRESENTS ONE OF THE BEST ASPECTS OF THE  AMERICAN DREAM. . . . SPONGEBOB HAS GOT SOME KIND OF UTOPIAN VERSION OF  LIFE IN HIS HEAD” (QUOTED IN BECK 2013, 33). THIS IS SIMILAR TO FRANCE’S  ERASURE OF THE MĀOHI PEOPLE’S EXPERIENCES WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING  IN FRENCH POLYNESIA, AS NOTED BY ANTHROPOLOGIST MIRIAM KAHN. KAHN  DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF THE TOURIST INDUSTRY IN CREATING NARRATIVES OF  PRISTINE BEAUTY THAT ERASE COLONIAL VIOLENCE AND KEEP INTACT  REPRESENTATIONS OF ISLANDS AS PLACES TO FULFILL THE DREAMS AND NEEDS OF  WESTERN TOURISTS (2011). MASS MEDIA ENABLES AMERICAN AND OTHER AUDIENCES  TO REMAIN OBLIVIOUS TO HISTORY AND POLITICS (GIROUX 2014). THE PUBLIC’S  PRIVILEGE OF IGNORANCE, HOWEVER, DEEPENS THE VIOLENCE RENDERED AGAINST  THE MARSHALLESE PEOPLE AND EXACERBATES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN “US” AND  “THEM.” THE IMPACT OF OTHERING AND WASTELANDING THE MARSHALLESE AND  THEIR ISLANDS SPONGEBOB PLAYS A ROLE IN OTHERING AND WASTELANDING THE  MARSHALLESE PEOPLE AND THEIR ISLANDS, BUT WHAT IMPACT DOES THE CARTOON  HAVE ON THE BIKINIAN PEOPLE WHO ARE PURPOSEFULLY EXCLUDED FROM THE  AMERICAN MEDIA DISCOURSE OF THE SHOW? CAN BIKINIANS ACCESS THE UTOPIAN  IDEAL THAT DOUG LAWRENCE DESCRIBED? WITH SPONGEBOB AND HIS FRIENDS  DEEPLY SETTLED INTO TERRITORY REPRESENTED AS AMERICAN, THE BIKINIANS NOT  ONLY ARE EXTRACTED  BARKER • UNSETTLING SPONGEBOB 361 FROM THEIR  HOMELANDS BUT ALSO BECOME EXPENDABLE WHEN THEY LEGALLY ENTER US DOMAINS.  MOST IMMIGRANTS WHO ENTER THE UNITED STATES LEGALLY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR  GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED SUPPORT SERVICES, PARTICULARLY THOSE DESIGNED TO  SERVE LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS MEDICAID OR SOCIAL SECURITY.  MARSHALLESE,  HOWEVER, INCLUDING THE BIKINI PEOPLE AND OTHERS FORCED FROM THEIR HOME  ISLANDS DURING THE COLD WAR, DO NOT. THROUGH THE COMPACT OF FREE  ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL  ISLANDS, THEY HAVE THE POLITICAL RIGHT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES TO  LIVE, GO TO SCHOOL, AND WORK; THEY PAY STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES, HAVE US  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, AND PAY INTO THE US SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM; AND  THEY SERVE IN EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF THE US ARMED FORCES. HOWEVER,  DESPITE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS, THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MANY OF THE  SERVICES THEY SUPPORT.13 THE EXPERIENCES OF BIKINIAN LUCKY JUDA  UNDERSCORE THE US POLICY IMPACTS OF OTHERING PEOPLE, IN THIS CASE BY  EXCLUDING MARSHALLESE FROM BENEFITS TYPICALLY EXTENDED T
