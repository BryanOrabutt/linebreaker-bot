Hi I’m 18 male and I have an issue with talking to girls.  Not only do I not know what to say and I’m nervous I feel like I’m no good for them.  I feel I’m not interesting, handsome, or not good enough for them.  Like I’ll see a girl and want to talk to them or introducing myself to them but I get these thoughts to turn myself away which: A. She probably likes someone better than me. B.  She probably has better standards that are better than me C.  I don’t deserve her D.  Even if by the grace of God I get to make her my gf, she will cheat on me for a better guy, break up with me.   I don’t know how to get over this but other guys make it so easy talking to girls seem so easy.  It’s even hard for me to become friends with a girl.  I’m not funny or witty.  The only thing I’m smart in is book smarts.  That’s it.  Every other guy she probably knows is funnier than me, better looking than me, smarter, everything.  And it’s really frustrating because I wanna be able to have someone love me.  I never get complimented or acknowledge by girls in the slightest so the thought of me finding love is getting lower every day.  I’m going to college soon and  i think it’s gonna get worse at taking to girls.  Even if I just wanna be friends with them the only thing I’ve learned to get get girls to talk to me or be my is if I make a fool out of myself.  Only thing I do is look at them and they look back but I don’t know to respond.  Like today I was at a book store and there was this girl checking out books near where I was checking out books.  She looked around my age and sense she was at a place I like to go she seemed like someone I would like to know.  And she wasn’t Super Duper drop dead attractive.  But to me she was attractive in my eyes that I would say she was cute ya know.  I wanted to talk to her but I stopped myself because all the thoughts I mentioned above.
