This is kind of just a big rant, so I’m sorry if I jump around or don’t make sense. It’s mostly just for me to vent. So maybe the title is understated, and probably something everyone deals with, but maybe as I (an eighteen year old female) type this I realize maybe I’m unsatisfied with myself and who I am?  Or a combination of both? Through high school, which is now basically over due to the virus, I’ve gone through many phases and tried to be friends with many people and ultimately done stuff to try to find who I am and where I fit in and things are good for a while usually but it always comes back to this standstill where even when I am surrounded by people I feel alone and like a background character even in my own life. I’m always second best to someone or something, which is probably to be expected but it still stings I guess. I have a great boyfriend who I’ve been dating for 2+ years now and sometimes he seems like my only true friend. I fear that I’m holding him back in life from the things he wants to do and the person he wants to be. So I don’t really wanna talk to him about this because I feel like I already drag him down a lot and I’m scared he’s maybe tired of me or losing what he once felt for me. I work a job, I’m in band, I’m in clubs, I’ve done sports, I’m in student government and other committees, and I’m constantly on the move being involved in as much as I can but it still feels as though I don’t actually exist even though I’m in all these places and it would actually be nice for someone to be like “hey! look at you! doin all these things and stuff! nice” Anyways, I fear in college nothing will change. I’m excited to get out of this town and have a new start with new people but I fear i’m not really a likable person. I don’t know, I’m not sure what I was hoping to accomplish, but I guess it would be nice to know I’m not crazy haha
