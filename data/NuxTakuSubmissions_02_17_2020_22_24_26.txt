Okay everyone all the haters and the toxic fans and the fans who get butt hurt too easily you should probably read this. My hero academia is being canceled because of one character of because of how unrealistic they are for those of you who know or can take a guess you know what I'm talking about or better yet knowbwhom I am talking about but, for those of you who don't know who I am talking about is of course Momo yaoyorozu a16 year  old Japanese female anime character. A lot of you have complained so much the point where the author of my hero academia is starting to consider getting rid of momo because and I quote "is unrealistic looking for a 16 year old girl" allow me to shed some light on the situation in real life there are 16 year old girls who go to high school And dress  sexy when I was in high school there are plenty of girls who dressed and sexy last night I was at the movies with my girlfriend celebrating our anniversary and there two 13 year olds dress in mature yet sexy fashion. My point a lot of you whining about the fact that a lot of manga and anime creators drawing teenage girls in over-sexualized matter and then you could damn them for something that you think is immoral and wrong and then you give give a lot of fans of anime and manga a lot of crap for liking fanservice 2 fact that you keep smearing their faces better 16 year old characters where is the key word the characters meaning they are not looking real okay are not sexist for liking fan surface or whatever bull crap you're going to say assume you win the plane in the comments quite frankly this will not affect me at all because I am one of the few people who understand the difference between reality and fantasy fancy playing tells us that this is a scenario will wear this will never happen and realistically I dunno they having Fancy on 16 year olds is moralely  wrong if they are real life people then it is wrong petsense they are just a bunch of cartoons I really don't see the damn problem and if some of you say in the comments well sometimes some sixteen-year-old are influenced by anime that they watch so they think that it's okay for them to do as well and I say to you well it's their own damn dumb fault for thinking that it's okay to dress this way but if they had half of a brain they would have figured out for themselves that this is not okay to dress this way and if they could not figure it out for themselves they could ask someone that they relied on like a good friend and asked them is this okay to dress this way hey is this okay and the obvious answer to that question is no not really and I'm not saying take away their  individuality no no no no what I'm trying to say is don't s*** on a careers work baby manga or anime cuz at the end of the day they're people too and they put their heart and soul and what they do and when people tell them that the work is basically crab because of a few things if they don't personally like themselves well the rest of the story and one that is actually pretty decent it makes them feel like crap and it's not just my hero academia that's going through so cancellation there's some others also there is a possibility of RWBY getting cancelled due to the overzealous of bumblebee shippers now I am a bumblebee shipper myself but I'm not  overzealous with it for those of you who read my entire rant on this s*** congrats but the point I'm trying to make is this if you're someone with an opinion just share it with your friends don't share it with the entire f****** internet don't write hate mail to any f****** anime or manga Creator cuz yes there are a few bad ones and yes they deserve to get cancelled but if they get canceled let it be of their own undoing and not because of one freaking character you feel is unrealistic
