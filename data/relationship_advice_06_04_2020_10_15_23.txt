My ex and I broke up 6 months ago and for the past 6 months we have been arguing pretty much every other day. She wasn’t in the beat place when we met and neither was I. We agreed we weren’t looking for a relationship but it ended up that way. Our breakup wasn’t very nice so when it happened it added to her emotional state which wasn’t very good to begin with. For the past 6 months she has asked me to try again which I have no interest in, she has called threading to kill herself or she claims she has attempted and failed. She blames me fore everything wrong in her life and how she is now. She blames me for her drinking every night and getting drunk. She has told me before that she is on 3 different medications even before we started dating and was being treated for a new one. She has told me she was seeing a therapist but that it wasn’t helping and she wanted a new one. Today she has threatened me to date her or she will kill her self but I talked long enough that we got away from that. She has threatened to beat me and kill me but I don’t know if she was drunk or not when she made those threats she says she was drunk and not credible. She also says if I were to call the cops or do anything she would sue me for defamation because I caused her to be this way. But she was hurt and like this before we started dating I could not handle it no matter how hard I tried to help and cared about her she needed professional help but she always claimed that I just needed to go back to her that I was her solution. But now she is claiming that she can sue me or her family can sue me and I can go to jail if she kills herself or if I call the cops on her suicide attempts because I didn’t do anything to help her or fix her or get back together there past 6 months. What can I do ? Can she really sue me ?
