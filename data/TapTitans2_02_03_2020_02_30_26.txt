Most you reading this are probably players under 10k or found this scrolling through the dozens of pointless recruitment threads. After not playing for a month ive come back to find this lack luster game just as dull as ever...the first real event in forever was cool...but doing it for third time...uhg...i barely tried the last time and still finished...and I dont even know what my clan won...the grind to lvl cards is so slow we have been bouncing between 2-20 and 3-1 since the release of tier 3...i have over 17k dust banked and no cards at lvl 10 lol and I don't even know what hero scroll sets do any more...whatever it is, it doesn't help me push stages...but then again nothing does anymore lol unless I wanna grind 15 hrs a day and prestige 20+ times a day just so I can still lose every tournament...changing builds does nothing...ive been stuck using SC because every other build too slow and require constant attention...cant wait for the next stage cap increase I won't be able to reach...and that's fine...ill just keep ignoring the milestone bundles and worthless pets, equips and perks in the shop and save my diamonds for a titan chest that only has relics and sp in it...well those are the only things in it I want or need...the dust and shards are nice but I have so much already that I'm not using having some more isn't a big deal...and the new legendary and rare set they plan to release won't even put a dent in my shard bank...and the next event set will just be a trophy to wear lol I'm sure the prizes won't scale again just like the last two events...getting the same amount of diamonds for 50 points and 1000 points is totally fair and worth the effort not to mention that awesome new avatar and all that dust we get if we pay for it...and in the mean time I can use the same 4 raid decks every 12 hrs to complete a raid and get the same rewards that dont actually help me complete the raid and faster or help my main game play progress further at all...and while I'm doing all of this day in and day out I'm getting the same puny daily login rewards and pet eggs...oh and lets not forget those awesome new pet quests I get to sift through in hopes I get ones that might help me push a few stages during a tourney even though I'll lose no matter how hard I try and push...i gave up trying to win months ago...but I think most players feel the same way cuz most hit ms then go back to farming and quit trying to push because it's so slow and just not worth the time...well that about covers what I am assuming is most players experience who are around the same MS as me...hard to wanna keep up that repetitive pattern isn't it?
