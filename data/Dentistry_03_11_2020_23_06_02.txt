I have never noticed it before but I think my gums are receding. I'm a 19 year old guy and I don't see this being due to poor hygiene, I have had braces for a fraction of my life due to severe crooked teeth and maybe this could be a culprit of shifting teeth, or when they took of the adhesive they probably shredded some of my gum. I've looked up many causes for this and perhaps it could be my fault for brushing hard mindlessly.                                                                                                                                               Ethir way I'd like to know how bad is it. I may be paranoid or Im like on the verge of losing my teeth but the front bottom ones feel a bit wiggily and I don't know what to do;\_;                                                  i'm still in highschool, my mom has paid a bunch for my siblings teeth and I. I have asked already but he said it was normal:( we have no insurance... and won't be able to get an apprenticeship that pays me until i graduate  so what could i do to hold up until i could fix it myself, or do you think it would be too late.
