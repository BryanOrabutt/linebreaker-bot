I was just going on a walk with my dad because self quarantining is a little boring. And a couple needed some help moving a couch. My old man owns a pickup truck and offered to help them out. The whole thing was a ton of fun for the most part. I helped get the couch in the truck and the woman(whoâ€™s name is Ainsly) helped me keep it on the bed while we moved it up the ramps. She was a really nice young woman and she kept talking about how weâ€™ll manned I was for a 22 year old and stuff like that. I swear she probably made me blush but I tried to ignore it since she was clearly with someone some way. They never really explained their relationship. So I never asked. Anyway, I decided to run up the ramp so if the couch fell out i could stop it. She eventually coaxed me into jumping on the back of the pickup and holding on like a garbage manðŸ˜‚. I did it and we road the truck up the ramp while my dad drove. It felt like so much fun. When we eventually got the couch into the apmt we were all talking and chatting up a storm. Ainsly, me, Nam, and my dad. I learned that she traines dogs to become service dogs for disabled children and young adults. I instantly had a lot of interest in her because I am in the grey about whether or not my social anxiety and other adhd stuff is enough to make me consider myself in any way disabled. Anyway. The whole time I was talking to her I felt so comfortable and safe. Itâ€™s terrible I know. But she made me feel like I didnâ€™t have to worry about being me. So I guess my question would be should I feel bad for feeling a kind of way about this woman? Or should I pursue my feelings further depending on if I ever see her again? Btw Nam wanted to give us his number for work and we ended up getting Ainslyâ€™s number. She didnâ€™t know his number. She asked me how I became such and exceptionally well rounded young man. And my heart exploded and I know I lit up. I donâ€™t know what to do with these sudden feelings that I think are very wrong.
