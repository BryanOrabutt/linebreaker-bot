So a long time ago there was a train conductor. And he worked conducting trains for a long time, and his favorite thing to do was to go really fast, especially on turns. But one day he went too fast on a turn and completely derailing it, and killed almost everyone on board. He went to court for it where they found him unanimously guilty, and he was sentenced to the electric chair. They asked him what he wanted for his final meal, and all he asked for was one banana. The guard that it was odd, but decided to let him have it. Then next day, they sat him in the chair, turned it on, but miraculously was totally fine. Back in those days, where he lived, they had a law that if someone survived the electric chair, they were free to go, because they thought it was God’s will that they live and go free. So a couple months later he gets his job back as a train conductor, but after just a few days he derails the train again killing half the people on board. Again he goes to court, and again he gets sentenced to the electric chair. The guard asks him what he wants for his final meal, and this time he says “2 bananas.” Again the guard thinks its odd, but grants him his request. The next day he gets put in the chair, and they turn it on, but again, he survives it, totally unharmed, and again they let him go. A few weeks later he manages to get his old job back again, but derails it again on his first day back, killing everyone on board. Again he goes to court, and again he gets sentenced to the electric chair. The guard asks him what he wants as his final meal, and he responds “3 bananas please.” The guard has enough of it and yells “no! Im not giving you 3 bananas! Every time you get sentenced you ask for bananas, and every time you survive, so no you’re not getting any bananas, what is it about bananas that makes you survive the electric chair anyway?” He looks at the guard and says, “oh the bananas have nothing to do with it, Im just a bad conductor”
