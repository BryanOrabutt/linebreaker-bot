It's getting old and dangerous seeing two "teams" of people talking past one another.  When there is only 90 seconds to make a point all we get is buzzwords and team bashing.  We must demand better from ourselves and our leaders.  Yes, both sides are correct!  Now have the rest of the conversation.  No not ALL cops are bad but when we find the ones that are we need to prosecute them instead of hiding or moving them.  Yes, we have the right to be outraged and protest but not destroy property.  That doesn't make anyone on the other side think we have a legitimate point to make and it hurts the community.  Yes guns in the hands of crazy people have the potential to cause a lot of harm.  But governments that controls the people's ability to defend themselves have turned tyrannical many times.  People can fuck up their lives on drugs but we can fuck up a lot of lives by trying to control what people put in their own bodies.  Women should have the ability to control their reproduction.  But trying to minimize the need for abortions isn't a bad thing either.  We don't want to be xenophobic or bigoted but we can't open the borders completely and let over a billion people we don't know come into the country seeking an opportunity to find there is none because there are too many people all of a sudden.  We don't want to see "blackface" ever again but someone dressing up as a person they admire who happens to be of a different race is not the same thing.  Forcing people to wear a mask and not gather in large groups can help with the coronavirus and save lives.  But when governments gain the ability to control the population they rarely give it back.  Both sides of all these conversations, and many others, need to be heard by everyone.  I am seeing too many of us play into this game as well.  When we start thinking there are only 2 teams and everyone on the other side is an idiot or a monster then we really and truly are fucked.
