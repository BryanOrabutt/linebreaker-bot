I recognize my unhealthy relationship with alcohol I go all week without drinking but as soon as I don't have work the next day all my mind goes to is drinking. This wouldn't bother me if I had an okay relationship with alcohol but it's not it's an incredibly unhealthy relationship. Several years ago I drank every single night going through a handle of vodka every few days and that was leading me down a very dark path. A friend of mine helped me get sober and I went to the gym with him 6 days a week and changed up my lifestyle to get healthy with the only exception being the bag of candy I kept on my computer desk to satisfy the sugar cravings. I spent the next several months sober and then decided to try drinking again in moderation except moderation seems to have meant only drinking on weekends but not limiting the amount I drink. I have had several times the last few years where I'll stop for a bit and then jump back in but I can't just have a beer or two. My brain won't let me just get a buzz and although I don't touch liquor anymore I more than make up for it in beer and wine. Firstly when I buy beer it can't be any lower than 8% in fact what I buy is 12 packs of 9% and usually a box of wine on top of that to get me through a 3 day weekend. In my mind I always need to buy more than I'll actually drink and I recognize this as an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It's not destroying my life but I hear about other peoples drinking habits and have to significantly downplay the amount I drink over the course of the weekend. Plus drinking all weekend leaves me tired all week and has left me incapable of getting on a decent sleep schedule and on top of that I keep gaining weight when I was drinking every day I had gotten up to 200 lbs (I'm only 5'8") I had lost 50 pounds the first time i quit drinking and had gotten myself in decent shape and now I'm back up to almost 190 and its slowly going up.
