Guys I woke up a couple of weeks ago and these was a package at my door. I opened the package and inside there was a box with a envelope and a picture of a African village . On the back of the picture was was writing that said “hello friend it’s me I have the track list for end of game the album it is enclosed in the envelope” so I opened the envelope and looked at the track list. However the track list was in Arabic so I looked on the envelope to see if I could figure it out but I became infatuated with this envelope, it was delicate and refined, nothing like the stationary where I’m from. And that reminded me of that song from the blue album about rivers eating envelopes and stuff and thought it must be a clue. So I decided to eat the envelope and pass it through to see if anything would show up. After a week of not going I passed it, how ever I couldn’t find it in my feces so I put the feces in a Chinese takeaway box and put it in the ice box and that reminded me of that one raditude song so I looked it up and I had to drown it. So after a couple days in the fridge I got a local wait lifter to throw the fridge in the neighbours pool. The neighbour was in the pool at the time and not happy demanding I get it out of the pool. After explaining the situation and showing him and his family the tracklist they gave me a message they have received with an address in the other side of the country to the Saudi embassy. After a week I was at the embassy and gave them the tracklist to which they kept hold of it and told me to give them the envelope. I explained where it was and they took me out to an ally way and repeated called me a stupid pigness while stepping on my head. When I was out of hospital I went to get the envelope but my neighbour had passed away and the fridge was face down in the pool so I was at a loss.
