What will happen in the long run to the universe after the galaxies start to die out one by one? the universe will slowly die out and what will happen to the afterlife then? the angels and demons, the souls or entities if you want to call it that, they will start to relocate from planet to planet and from galaxy to galaxy. That will happen until a certain point, that's because while they are doing this other galaxies are dying out, black holes are expanding, the universe is shrinking and about to collapse to re-create the big bang. The entities all around the universe gathered to find a solution on how to escape from getting killed for good by the black holes that are getting expanded and the other black holes that are colliding to merge into a bigger one. The leader of the light entities summoned every other light being to a meeting and told that they need to work with the dark entities to find a way and survive, so they all went down and down till they eventually reach the bottom, the dark entities saw a huge and never ending army of light entities and they started to gather also thinking it's war time to finally decide who will rule the afterlife and all the other dimensions. But the leader of the light entities said to stop, we did not come here for war but to help each other in this time of need. The highly vibration light spoke to the other entities thru wavelengths to make them understand that there will be no benefits to no one if they do not work together to expand and run away from the black holes that are getting bigger and colliding with each other,but the low vibration entities started to get mad that the light entities spoke for them, and they only wanted them to expand the universe while the light entities fight off the expanding black holes and make the universe to fit the dark entities even more. The light entity told them that everything need's a balance, if they really wanted to do that they can go and do it but they will get bored fast of doing everything they wanted to do with no consequences, even the living will get bored from doing crimes and eventually everyone will return to normal to create equilibrium in the living world and the afterlife. Every entity understood and started working towards expanding the universe while re-creating new galaxies that could inhabit better life form than it was before, thus leading to higher intelligence and will lead to finding faster solution to be able and communicate with entities from other dimensions and afterlife to come together and solver once and for all the chaos that the black holes are making, now there is new and better life forms with better intelligence on the new galaxies and everything is back to normal, except, there will always be someone working on expanding the universe so we can keep a safe distance while running from the huge black holes that are following the galaxies but if they will not consume anything, with time they will collapse and explode destroying almost everything, from time to time we must sacrifice planets, solar systems and even galaxies to the black holes or we will die after they collapse on itself.
