I have been dating this guy named A for about a year now, and couple months into our relationship he had to move in with me and lost his jobs and things turned a bit rough and he got very insecure and made me block all my friends. We had a lot of good days and I love him so much I never connected and felt so comfortable and wanted to marry someone in my life. But then he got these toxic days were he would start fights and accuse me of cheating for no reason and they’ll get really bad and sometimes he would hit me, but he also suffers from aspergers so I don’t blame him he can’t control it sometimes, but he had this one really rough fight and he gave me a black eye and I broke up with him and kicked him out. But I still love him so much and know he was just going through a lot he had a lot of stress his parents kicked him out and disowned him, he lost both of his jobs, got kicked out of college for failing. And I did aggravate the fights sometimes too to try to hurt him back, which was wrong of me I know. But we have been broken up for 3 weeks and I recently started being Friends with two of my old friends and my ex hates them, and we started talking civilly and he is promising to change and knows everything he did was wrong and we share something I can’t explain. But he says he needs time for my friends and that I’ll have to have one blocked for a bit untill he is comfortable with him  but I’m allowed to have my other friend but my friends don’t even want me getting back together with him, but I believe he has it in him to change and I love him so much and don’t know what should I do? Should I try to fix my relationship and regain my love of my life and my bestfriend, but have my one friend blocked and my other one mad at me and maybe leave me. And end up with no friends again. Or should I move on and block him on everything and start a new chapter in my life?
