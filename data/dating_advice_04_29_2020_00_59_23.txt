One of my (23M) friends (21F) recently broke up with her boyfriend of a year. Over the span of a few weeks she seemed to be very flirtatious with her actions and words. For example, she was saying "we should spend more quality time together", "I don't deserve you", & "Emma Chamberlain's the perfect girl for you, you're going to marry Emma Chamberlain", "people say I'm a lot like Emma Chamberlain". She seemed to be wanting to get back in a relationship and I asked why she didn't want to date either two of her other guy friends and she said they annoyed her, so I asked if I annoy her and she said "never, I always enjoy spending time with you". I invited her to watch 'the Bachelor' with my friends and she was very touchy with me and playing footsie, so they all thought she was obviously into me. A few months ago there was a girl I was interested in and my friend asked her what she thought about me. I had no idea this happened and my friend brought it up recently. When I asked what the girl said my friend said she blanked out bc she was just thinking "YA HES REALLY COOL". My friends thought this was bs and that she was into me, but idk for sure. She used to compare me to her boyfriend too much when they were dating, so I told her that made me uncomfortable and she stopped. So we were hanging out a while ago and she started taking selfies of us and added them to her Instagram and tried to tag my twin sister who she'd never met, which I thought was weird. She then wanted to go camping alone with me five hours away, which was when I felt like I needed to bring all this up. I hadn't thought about it more than a day, so told her I thought I had feelings for her and asked if how she felt towards me and it wasn't reciprocated which surprised me. Idk if I read too much into everything, but historically when girls talk to me like this they've wanted a relationship, so I kinda feel led on. Is this just how some girls talk or was I led on?
