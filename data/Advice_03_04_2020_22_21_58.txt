This will probably sound weird, which it is. But almost every night I have this dream about a girl, I don't know ***who*** she is, ***where*** she came from, or ***why*** she has infested my dreams. I swear I have never seen this woman in my life, but i seemingly know a lot about her except for her ***name***. She has Long brunette/red waist length hair, a petite build, with a thin waist, bust *slightly* above average for her size, and thighs/butt that matches the rest of her fairly small size. I assume we must have met in university as I recall seeing her in a school setting, so my guess is for her age to be around 18-23. I never seem to be at the same height as her (ie. she is sitting down, while I standing or vise versa) but I assume she would be around 5'5 - 5'7.(I should also mention that i haven't ever seen her full face, only her cute smile and her big eyes, but never at the same time.) But the real important part is her ***personality***, she sounds wonderful, she is the life of the party and everybody loves her and is just extremely kind hearted and honestly kinda selfless (ie always caring for other people/ giving to people who needs more than her at the moment). In my dreams the girl has said she was my girlfriend but treats me as a brother, as in i'm still very important to her but she still jokes around and doesn't hold back with kindly insults. She is fierce and can protect herself if she needed to, but seems to prefer for me to initiate the interaction if i'm able to and relies on me for protection if available. For her hobbies, i'm not quite sure, but if I had to guess i'd say she was probably into gardening, painting, and possibly gaming (just from what she wore, the way she spoke, and the stuff lying around her apartment/house.) She is ***literally*** my dream girl (possibly why she is in my dreams?) Now I should have mentioned that I have ***never*** been in a relationship with anyone before. And I am a teenager (15 M) and is currently going through puberty, **but** I have experienced "wet dreams" where i get intimate, but i have never done anything intimate with her, the closet i have ever gotten was cuddling on the couch.  So, my question is, ***Is*** this girl out there in the world ***somewhere*** having the same dreams as I am? Or is this my young hormonal brain trying to make me happy? I will admit that i'm not the most attractive guy, but in the past month where this girl has been in my dreams, ***constantly***, I have been extremely motivated to get into shape (as I am in my dreams) in hopes of recreating what happens in those dreams. This girl seems to be all I can focus on nowadays, and I am planning to tell my therapist about it once I see them again. But can any of you tell me what the heck is going on? Is this some type of soulmate mumbo jumbo going on, or am I just wanting a relationship so badly that i'm having to make up fantasies? (note that I wasn't having feelings    of being lonely from lack of relationship until after I started having these dreams more frequently.) Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if its not exactly what id like to hear. (Also sorry for any spelling mistakes, i did my best.)
