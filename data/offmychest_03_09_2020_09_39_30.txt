Because I had a horrible head injury years ago from a roadside bomb in iraq when I was a young man I spent a year in Augusta GA in 08 at the TBI rehab for my injury... I have bipolar/psychotic I take heavy mood stablizers anti-pyschotic for. At times I lose my shit in not a physically abusive way(i was years ago when I was still heavy on painpills from the blast in 08-09) but rant rave and lose my shit over trivial things and I often wonder if I should take my life instead of subjecting my family to my aggressive depressed  insanity. Ive been on medications for a decade Ive been in and out of psych wards. Im positive my wife stays because I make a very healthy living through the VA being disabled... I would have killed myself a long time ago but I carve out life because the quality of life and benifits provided for my wife and kids. Ive made strides and have gotten better of the decade about bieng a horrible human, ive gotten clean and have lots of help through the VA but I still yell and get very upset over things I onow are trivial after the fact.... Im sick of the medications... Im sick of my family walking on eggshells and fearing me... I really feel like they would be happier without me but then they wouldn't receive my benifits and my kids would not get into colleges without burden with debt... I don't go around and complain about my time as a grunt in iraq to everybody, I dont bug my friends or family about much as I do see therapists but ive been seeing them for a decade and them and meds and going to the crazy house are just not working anymore.... Ive looked into trying to live in a trailer and live as cheaply as possible and giving the rest to my wife to support my kids and her.  Im def not going to kms I feel very low rn... And had to get this feeling off my chest... Im most likely gonna spend a very long time at the 3rd floor in nashville va because I just dont feel well right now..
