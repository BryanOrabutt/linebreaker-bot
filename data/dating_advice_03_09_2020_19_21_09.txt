I love him but I don’t like him; I’m 18 years old and we’ve been dating for about 5 months now when I started dating him I didn’t considered him handsome although many of my friends did, with the time a started to like his physical appearance but the reason why I dated him in first place is because he’s was everything I wanted in a boy (smart, funny, humble and affectionate) I like to read and he likes it too... for this 5 months we have had a lot of little fights for jokes because both of us like to be right. He wrote me a letter saying that if he annoyed me that much (I told him yesterday “ why are you that annoying?”) Why I don’t break up with him? Because he thinks having that much fights isn’t normal and I agree so I talked with him and I told him I wouldn’t be mad all the time (pretty toxic uh) hours after that he started texting me and telling jokes about marriage with me (he usually does that and I think is cute) but the next day (Monday) in Mexico is a movement where the women is going to be at home and don’t use any social media in order to protest against the feminicides in the country. In Facebook he post “the girl who comes at school will be rewarded with a muffin”.......I was like hahaha so funny not really wtf is wrong with him, but I didn’t say anything because I can’t use any social media until tomorrow, BUT in my classroom we have a WhatsApp group (he isn’t in the group but the whole classroom is) where some boys screenshot the post and where saying “I’m the only one or no one sees the joke?” I agree with them because it wasn’t something he could joke about in the other hand “my bf” has told me that he respect women and he’s treats me like a lady idk why he did that but it really annoyed me, besides everybody knows me in the classroom bc I’m a feminist so.... by the way I just checked and he remove the post.thats the tea sis sorry bc is to long. Whatshouldido??
