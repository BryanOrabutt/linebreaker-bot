My mom is like a cloud over my life. When I wake up in the morning to get ready for school, everytime I walk past her room she yells "who is that?!" and it's me every single time, because I'm the only person whos room comes from the direction I'm coming from. I tell her to have a good day before I leave, and when I get on the bus she asks me if I'm on the bus, I tell her yes every time, nothing will change. She texts me so many times while I'm at school its so infuriating. I just want to have my head clear from this. Whenever I walk out of my room to go to the bathroom she yells "where are you going?!" As if I'm not allowed to walk around in the house I live in. I don't like to talk to her about my day because she never remembers anyway, if I tell her about something that happened at school she won't remember it when I bring it up again, and sometimes she even makes things up that she thinks I've told her. Whenever she calls my name she yells it in a way that gives me anxiety which I've explained to her that I can hear her call me without her yelling because my room is right next to hers, she doesn't care and accuses me of criticizing her. All these things I feel like to most people would seem very little but they add up and stress me out and it makes me want to avoid my mother. When I have friend's over she will come in to my room and ask "XXX why do you never talk to me?" Like thats an appropriate thing to ask in front of people. She tells her boyfriend that she thinks I hate her in front of me which is very uncomfortable and makes me want to avoid her more. She talks about me on the phone to her friends like I'm a baby and don't know. All of this just adds up and makes me very anxious when I'm around her, I feel like she feeds off of feeling like a victim and it's making me depressed. I don't hate my mom, but she's making it hard to be around her
