So I have had 9 weeks of physical therapy, and my therapist has been able to insert the third size dilator in me but 1) it takes a long time. 2) I havent been able to do it myself. I made a previous post about how to get comfortable even looking at my vagina and I have been forcing myself to look at it for 5 minutes a day but still havent been able to touch myself. I was not abused (atleast I dont think I was because I have mo recollection of anything like that) and dont really know the cause of my vaginismus but  I’ve been very frustrated the past two weeks. I look in the mirror at it and try to touch around it but it just makes me sooo overwhelmed and makes me cry. Lately I’ve been falling into a hole of very dark and negative thoughts which isnt really my regular thought pattern but I think vaginismus is really taking a toll on my emotions. My physical therapist is awesome but shes moving so I only have one more appt with her then I am going to a different therapist who apparently is very nice and awesome too. Im proud of the progress that I have made considering I kept this a secret for 4 years but I am feeling like im not putting in enough effort into my stretches and meditation and I just feel like everytime I get overwhelmed trying to put my finger even near the hole it makes me even less motivated because I just want all of this to be overwith. I am such a busy person I work two jobs while going to college full time. My therapist also recommeded getting acupuncture done because one of her former patients who was cured said acupuncture from this specific doctor was what helped her the most. I just need some motivation to put in the work and just some advice from people that have been in the same boat. I feel like im not even a real woman and that I dont want to live anymore and then I think about how my feelings arent valid because people have it so much worse but im just so overwhelmed with this whole situation. Sorry just really needed to vent.
