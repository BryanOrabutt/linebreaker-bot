First off, I really hate complaining but I'm just looking for some advice. So I was hired back in November for Customer Service Associate. I never have worked for a Walgreens in the past. So 2 months ago I ended up getting put on warehouse and the reasoning was cause I was doing so well learning everything else. My dilemma is I was unaware warehouse was at 1:45 am - 11 am, apparently my ASM told me this when she hired me and she did not I think she told the other girl that was hired at the same time as me it cause I would have remembered this. She did say the store is open 7 am - 10 pm and it looks like u have open availability which I said yes cause I put on my application I was available from 7 am - 10 pm, to my understanding that's what I thought she was referring to was when the store opens till close. Anyways, I've been on truck straight every week since and a lot of co-workers have noticed this and said it was unfair and that's where my ASM said I agreed to this when I was hired which makes me upset cause I didn't agree to it, is there something in my file I can look at to see what I agreed to? I'm just getting a little pushed over the edge and feel like I'm getting taken advantage of. I don't mind helping out for truck but every single week I'm scheduled for it and now it to the sounds of it I'm permanently stuck on it. If I wanted to work an overnight job I would have applied to one and I get it's once a week but I don't get Saturdays off anymore or even Sundays and rarely Fridays. Not to mention she schedules me sometimes until 5 or 6 pm the night before truck too how am I supposed to get enough sleep when I have to wake up at 1 am!?!. Ugh! So at this point I'm just really at loss what to say or do cause I know it needs to be brought up and talked about just don't know how to approach it and wanted to see if there was an agreement on file first before I say something. Thanks for letting me rant a bit!
