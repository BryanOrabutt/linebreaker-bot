I am back in college after many years and as you would expect of someone being in college I am broke basically all the time. those things no one would miss about those times, right? So now that it is summer vacations in my country I've decided to find myself a summer job to make some easy money before the classes start back and I go broke again and now every morning I spend a few times there, but I am still able to go back home for lunch which is a blessing if you ask me - there is no food like homemade. For context, I live in a neighborhood that is far from being high class and our condo is located at the end of a road that is made by a huge cemitery on one side and an abandoned school on the other - it sounds made up, I know, but one can only swear. I am living here for over 5 years now and we never had any issue with those factors, besides busy moments on november 2 and some cats and dogs that people are heartless enough to leave here thinking no one is ever gonna notice, since everyone thinks the road ends on the end of the cemitery. Anyways I always have my headphones on when I am walking outside and on this particular day I've got a ride halfway home so I was too lazy to pick up my phone and headphones to turn something on on Spotify for what would be a 10 minutes bus ride and a 5 minutes walk home, so I was just listening to my own thoughts on the walk by the cemitery and I am also paying attention to this little boy walking on the other side of the sidewalk, just a few steps ahead of me. He is very young, about 7 or 8 and he has a giant backback which caughts my attention and I am just thinking about it when I start hearing children voice coming from the abandoned school's yard. They are calling a name and the boy hears it too because he stops on his tracks, paying attention before putting his hands up close to his mouth to shout out a "who is it?!" and I laugh to myself about it, realizing it was probably his friends calling him or something and then he asks again "who is it?!" but before it could get any answer he decides to check, saying "I am coming!" and walks inside the school's patio and I keep going on my way. I thought there was no reason to worry since what I heard was clearly a group of children calling a friend and the boy seemed happy with it so it was non of my business. Not a second later, though, I start hearing the kids shouting out again and this time... well, this time they were calling ME. Not by my name, not by "hey girl", not by anything else than the nickname only close members of my family know about, it is in fact a way that only the elder ones of my blood would call me and some of them are long gone by now. It is loud and clead and I stop on my tracks just like the boy did, but I don't dare to look to where the voices are coming. After years of paranormal experiences you get a kind of sense when it is something like that that is going on so I just try to tell myself it is not me they are calling, it must be someone else they are trying to call and I look at the street behind me and there is no one else there, I am alone and there was no one else they could be calling for. Mind that since the first time they called my nickname they haven't stopped, it is continuous and always on the same tone so I keep walking and a few seconds later my curiosity gets the best of me and I look to where the voices are coming from but I see no one, not for my surprise since there are a few trees on the way but still I should be at least seeing the boy that just walked in to the yard, right? But I see no one while they keep calling that nickname, keep calling for me. I am not scared or anything but something tells me to just keep going home and pretend it is nothing, that they are gonna give up once they realize I am not giving in, so that is what I do but they never stop, until I finally make the turn that leads to my condo's gate I can still hear them calling out my nickname on that same tone, from the same place. Nothing happened after that, I walked in and it was the weekend so I haven't walked on that sidewalk for two days now, but I know I am gonna have to tomorrow and to be honest I am planning to have my headphones up and the volume on the highest to be sure I won't here the voices again if they decide to keep calling for me.
