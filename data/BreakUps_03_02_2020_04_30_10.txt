I just have to talk to someone about this because I can't get it out of my mind tonight and I have a lot of work I need to do so I thought maybe writing it out would help. I read a lot of different shit online about breakups and getting over someone, and some of what people say makes me feel like my situation isn't so unique and I'm just blinded to a relationship that could never work again. But if that's the case, why can I so clearly see my paths crossing with his again. I think most people can easily look back at the happy times in a relationship, but it's not that I can't see myself with anyone else. It's that I've never met a human being anything like Him. He's genuine, smart, fun and I truly think he has one of the kindest hearts. Nobody has ever looked at me the way he has, like I'm the most beautiful girl out there. And I've had my heart hurt before, and I've loved before, but nowhere near the way I loved Him. I don't like to blame myself for what happened because I know we both had our issues, but he never stopped trying and I know I needed to take a step back, but I feel like I ripped out his heart in the process. I feel like he'll never see me the same. I'll always be that girl that left him scarred. I guess what I'm trying to get at is everyone tells me to move on, don't hold on to hope, let him go. But I don't know how to deny myself hope? It just comes naturally that I have hope in a future with him. I know that letting go of someone hurts, but I'm not scared of being hurt. I'm honestly not scared. I guess I'm wondering if I should listen to everyone else and just try and get over him, or continue to believe in what I believe in. Which is him and I. Idk. Things are strange, and weird these days. I feel lost half the time. And I want to bring him to all the places I've discovered since we ended, because I'd know he'd like it. And if I could make him smile again, I'd be the happiest mother fucker. So if youâ€™re out there reading this, I miss you. Always.
