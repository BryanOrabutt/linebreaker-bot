In Portuguese we have a word that no other language has. ''Saudade''. it basically means ''the feeling of missing something''. I have Saudade of you. A lot. we haven't talked in a while but I know you are doing well and I hope things keep this way. I'm drunk as fuck and I miss you. I really want to talk to you again but I know I shouldn't. I am alone in a country where I don't' know anybody, I barely speak the language and that is just making things worse, I can't leave my home for God's sake. I mean, I know you are not the best version of yourself at the moment, I just hope you are happy with him. who knows, maybe we will talk again soon? I have been looking forward to that for a while now. Here I am writing in a dumb website things that I wanted to tell you in person but I can't. I (think) I know why you ghosted me and even tho I don't agree with the reason, I respect it. We both know that we are perfect for each other, but I had to move. I know that being more than 8500km apart isn't a good thing, but you have no idea of how much I wanted to stay just because of you. Shit. and everyday is the same thing, I see how happy you are with him and how good things are for you, and I wish you all the best, but I know you. This has happened before. You always come back to me when you are feeling alone. every 6 months or so you are back, and I am a fucking fool for always waiting for you, but I have tried everything. I have met other people, traveled, distracted myself, it doesn't matter. You always come back to my head. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I just want you to be happy and I wish the same for me. I just want to either forget you or talk to you again, but I know any of this things are happening. Well, I guess I will just keep going forward, waiting for the next time you are coming back to me. ''Saudade'' of you is killing me. I miss you.
