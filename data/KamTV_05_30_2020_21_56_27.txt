hi all James here um I'm currently traveling abroad and just woke up but I wanted to sit down and make a video addressing all everything that's going on right now because they offer memory I owe everybody an explanation but most importantly I owe two important people an apology to Tati and James Westbrook um I'm sorry for everything that is going on everything that I have to put you through over the past few weeks I met Tati and James almost three years ago now when I was first coming into the industry and when I had no friends and nobody to talk to or look up to and Tati very quickly took on a parental role with me because she knew my parents were across the country and over the past few years of knowing her family her and her husband have given me so much love and advice and opportunities and a place to stay and a shoulder to cry out at 3:00 in the morning and support when nobody else would or wanted to and it and I'm so disappointed in myself that I ruined our relationship that that did mean so much to me even if I didn't to the best job of showing it all the time and throw all of this what sucks the most is that I know there's nothing I can say or do to ever earn that friendship or trust back but I don't blame them for it a lot of my most of my career over the past few years has been about me making mistakes and trying to learn and grow from them and I haven't always done the best job of that I can admit that but I have always tried because I know there's a lot of people watching me and that a lot of people look up to me as a role model and I hate knowing that I disappointed not really them but most importantly to people that have been role models to me doing this I wish that I could say this is the last time that I would make a mistake but it won't be I know that of disappoint people more and more as I continue to learn and grow every single day I have a long way to go very long way to go but that's okay um I'm gonna keep trying my best and keep learning and growing and be the best version of me that I possibly can be I'm sorry for that in regards to the Coachella situation with the brand deal on the security guard I've already told my truth about this twice and instead of talking about it for a third time and explaining it and going into detail and pulling up receipts it doesn't matter and I'm I understand that no matter what I say or do they're always going to be people that don't believe me and will think that I'm lying that's okay at this point the truth really does not matter it's the feelings that do and no matter what happened I heard two very very important people and they've been really really loyal to me and I ain't betrayed that no songs and I wish more than anything that I could take it back in regards to the boys situation boys have been a topic that I've talked a lot about on my social media journey and it's a topic that I wish I hadn't I've been involved a lot of very unique and strange situations that I've left people confused or upset and I've learned the hard way about ways that I can interact with boys that I'm interested in and also ones that I should or shouldn't be talking to this is a conversation that I know a lot of people are uncomfortable with and it's something that I should have been far more careful with bringing into the public eye especially with a lot of situation that just happened I've had to learn it the hard way but coincidentally enough talk to you really was one of the people to sit me down and tell me how it looked from the outside and let me know hey talking to these boys might get you in trouble one day and she's right in regards to my own mother well I know you want to defend me and fight for me and go off on comments but I ask that you don't this is my problem that I thought myself into and this is my job to deal with this no matter what is anybody is saying or commenting or talking about mom I need you to know that you're the most important person in my life and think you are an amazing mother and I don't know what I would do without you and I'm so grateful for everything that you've done for me and the lessons that you have taught me and and everything that you continue to do for me and my brother and I need you to know that engage you to know that and the same thing goes for Tati as well who is an amazing person and truly does want the best for everybody around her I'm so disappointed myself that I her um a lot of times when I've had to address things in the past I knocked it out of impulse and I've got off and tried to pull receipts or fax or screenshots it'll play the victim and I'm not doing that today kind of loud to say I'm sorry
