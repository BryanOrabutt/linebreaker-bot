imagine if male genitals were treated like female genitals? Like testicles weren’t even referred to as testicles and some men didn’t even know what they were actually called and the general area was just called “penis”.                                           imagine if boys were told that their prostate doesn’t exist. Imagine if hairy genitals on men were called “bearded snakes.” And they don’t know how many different openings they have until adulthood.                                                       imagine if men were flocking en mass to get “testicle tightening” surgeries.  imagine if men weren’t taught that they could have orgasms.                                                                    Imagine if it were considered rude to say “penis” even in debates regarding legislature involving medical care about men’s penises.                   Imagine penis was a word that was considered too “dirty” to be said on television.                  Imagine if penis’s were depicted only as meat-sticks that fit in vaginas with no other value.  Imagine if teenage boys heard joke after joke about how all dicks smell terrible no matter what.  Imagine if the ideal male genitalia were small and hairless like a prepubescent boy’s, and larger/hairier male genitalia was considered gross and sloppy.                                                                             Imagine if people didn’t understand how penises ‘work’ and therefore their orgasms didn’t matter. Imagine if having a penis meant you were paid less money.                                                               Imagine if unreciprocated cunnilingus were the norm.                                                                         Imagine if boys were taught that sex was expected to hurt for them and were told to lie back and think of England, to grin and bear it.  Imagine if male reproductive conditions were under-researched and under-treated. No known cause, no known cure was the default. Reproductive pains considered normal for men, and their reproductive complaints mocked and dismissed.                                                                Imagine that teenage boys were put on hormonal birth control, perhaps because they’re thought to help these mysterious ailments but with the side effect of making them sexually available to women all the time without risk of pregnancy.                                                               Imagine if male hormonal cycles (high T in the morning, low T at night) were mocked and considered to make men unreliable. If men’s competence and judgment was questioned because of it (“He’s just mad because it’s that time of the day! They’re so testerical in the morning” or “Can a man really hold office if he’s just going to start crying every time the evening rolls around and his T drops?”, including worse mockery for older men who have lower T in general and might have erectile dysfunction, prostate cancer, or other older male reproductive issues).                                                                       Imagine if there was legislation on men’s right to ejaculate without the intent to reproduce because “every sperm is sacred”.
