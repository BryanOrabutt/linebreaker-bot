Hey so a few years ago when I was checking myself down below I discovered a small lump on my right testicle and the reason why I ignored it and I didn't get it checked out I didn't go into a hospital or anything was mainly because the idea of some doctor guy touching me down there kind of grossed me out and I guess I was also kind of worried that if he touched me down there and I got an erection does it mean I'm gay and I was also kind of worried that it might actually be cancer you know testicular cancer could be a possibility if you have a lump on your testicle that's kind of what it could be and I did some googling and a lot of people were saying that just because you have a lump on your testicle it doesn't necessarily mean that it's cancer it could be something else like a vein or a piece of tissue not tissue paper but like tissue as in flesh so I guess I just convinced myself that it's it's not cancer because it doesn't hurt and it's been a few years since I discovered it and nothing's happened it's not gotten bigger there's no pain developing so maybe it's nothing to worry about if I could I would like to get it checked out I would like to find out what it is but like I said before I really don't want some guy touching my genitals it's just weird and it would be so embarrassing if I suddenly got an erection if it was a nurse doing it and they got an erection I wouldn't really mind well actually that would be pretty embarrassing as well. I don't understand why the doctor has to touch the lump anyway I know there's a lump there because I can feel it why can't I just tell the doctor hey I have a lump would you mind not touching it because I know there's a lump there you touching it as well and finding out that there's a lump isn't really going to help things can't you just put me in the scanning thing and then find out if it's cancer or not or if it's just nothing is it really necessary for you to touch me I don't even know if you can die from testicular cancer if you just ignore it what's the worst that could happen if the worst that could happen is I just become unable to make children, that actually sounds like a good thing but if you said that I would die if I if I left it untreated then I guess I would have no choice but to get it checked out this kind of reminds me of when my ex-girlfriend got chlamydia and my ex-girlfriend had to go and get herself checked out at the hospital she was Japanese and she described to me what they did and it was really weird she said she had to take off her underwear and her knickers and her trousers and she had to spread her legs and they put a camera up there and the doctor was touching around and I didn't know how to feel about that I mean yeah he's a doctor but he's also a man and he was touching my girlfriend's vagina I  bet secretly he absolutely loves his job or maybe he hates it after you've seen 250 vaginas a day maybe you don't really care about it anymore it's just like a piece of flesh to you so I guess I have two questions are there any guys here who also found the lump on their testicles and when to get it checked out what was it was it cancer was it nothing what was the experience like did the doctor touch you did he touch you for long was it over really quickly?
