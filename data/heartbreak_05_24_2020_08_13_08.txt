hi i am really struggling.....i broke up with the person i loved the most and it was a bitter sweet 2 years relationship we knew at some point that we don't have a future together but we still tried she then cheated on me i was always like if you can find someone with whom you see a future and your happiness then go for it but she still choose to play me and betray me lying and cheating all along i did everything for her i never did things for even my family as much as i did for her but still she did this to me and when i confronted her she said its you who doesn't want to keep things with me so go on and she blocked me from everywhere.....she is a single parent child and i helped her a lot i used to hold her hands while crossing a road because she was afraid and call me all the time when she was afraid at night now i am just a noone just like that.....the breakup happened in January and its been 4-5 months of no contact and i just checked her social media because i was worried about her in this pendemic and what i found out is she is engaged and happy and i personally wanted that but it hurts me a lot because after everything i am nothing to her she is with someone and happily moving on enjoying her life after putting at a place where i have lost myself completely struggling to hold on trying to survive.......i just wanted her to understand how much i loved her that i put her above everything even when i was hurting  and breaking inside......if nothing i just wanted to be a part of her if nothing just as a friend but instead she choose to destroy me completely...it hurts me most to see her changed like this i saw the light all along inside her during all the dark times and here i am ended up in darkness burning myself all along to light up her paths....the pain i am feeling i can't explain my fingers are shaking while even typing this post......i just want this to end.....i don't want to feel anything anymore not love not pain no nothing just take it away please....
