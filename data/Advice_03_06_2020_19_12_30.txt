Last year I got back into horse riding (I used to ride when I was little but never had my own horse) and was considering buying/adopting a horse as I had a friend who was a horse rider with a lot of experience who was looking to move her horse somewhere new and a family member of mine was renting out his stables. My stepmum owns a pony and after hearing I wanted to get a horse she offered to let me have her pony, I took the opportunity with both hands as that kind of luck never comes along and my friend and stepmum assured me they would help me learn everything I needed (my stepmum also told me that if I couldn’t handle it just tell me and she would take her back). This worked well for a few months until my friend decided to move her horse into full livery as she didn’t have time to do it herself everyday with her new job. My friend used to pick me up and we would go together so without her it already made it more difficult for me to go as much but I pushed on and after a month or so my grandad started giving me a lift there and back as I don’t drive yet. However since then I have had to get another job which means I have a lot less free time (I have two jobs now) so I haven’t been able to go as much and my grandad and stepmum have really been doing most of the work (aside from paying as I am still paying for everything for her) they assure me they don’t mind and I can tell she’s being really well looked after but I feel like I never have any time to see her myself now and because of this she has stopped listening to me as much and her behaviour is getting worse around me. I’ve been thinking for a while about asking my stepmum to please take back over her for me as I just don’t have the time and I’m struggling money wise now as I’m paying for driving lessons, saving to put a deposit on a house and paying for everything to do with the pony but despite thinking all this I love her to death and I’ve been trying to go up more but tonight her behaviour was the worst I’ve seen it and she actually landed a kick on my stomach (I wasn’t stood Behind her or anything I let her off her headcollar and she bolted in front and kicked back and hit me) it was only light as I was a fair distance away but it’s made me think that maybe I can’t hack it after all. I’m so conflicted because I really love her but I don’t think I have the time/skills to keep her if I’m being totally honest. I’m worried everyone including my stepmum will be mad and me and think I’m pathetic for not being able to handle it and I’d hate to ruin the relationship I have with her and my dad. Opinions please
