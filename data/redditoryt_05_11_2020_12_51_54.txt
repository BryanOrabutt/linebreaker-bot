So this happened a few years ago, when I was still in my old neighborhood before I moved, I had a friend that had a trampoline. (me = me, Nf = Nice friend, Fs = friend sister, Em = Entitled mum, Ek = Entitled kid, M = Mum, Fm = Friend's mum) So we were wrestling on the trampoline with me, nf, and fs. Nf's sister loved wrestling (idk why don't ask me) So we wrestled on his trampoline, and then Ek and Em come over. Ek says, "I wanna play" and I said "Sure the more the marrier" (BIG MISTAKE)  (btw Fs is only like 6 years old and Ek I'm guessing is 8-10 years old) So since Ek and Fs are the youngest and wrestled first. (I guess Ek watches a lot of WWE) First Ns Fireman's him and does a hip throw on him, then Ek goes rage mode. He RKO's Ns, Picks her up and throws her, then chokeslams on her, bounced up, and he canon balled down and Fs gets thrown out of the trampoline (she got scratches and bruises) Em starts cheering that Ek won. I charge tackle EK and Nf goes to see if Fs is okay. Then Em started bawling like a little 3-year old that "I'm hurting her angle and I'm just a sore loser" Then Em runs into the trampoline and throws me out of the trampoline and I crash into Fm's rose bushes. (I got some cuts and bruises im fine) Then Nf runs inside and calls for help. (help in M and Fm) Fm and M come outside and see Me in a rose bush, Fs on the floor, Ek screaming he won!, and Em being like the WWE announcer saying, "THE UNBEATABLE CHAMPION EKKKKKKKKKKKKK" Then me and Fs told our mum's everything, M: What the h\*\*\* are you f\*\*\*ing doing?!?! Em: Ek won!!!! Fm gets the first aid kit and helps me out of the bush. M:  GET YOU AND YOUR F\*\*\*ING H\*\*\* SPAWN OUT OF HERE NOWWWW!!!! Em: Sore Loser why should I and Ek also deserves a reward for winning, it's only fair. Ek: I want the trampoline. Em: Yeah, give Ek the trampoline!! Em starts dragging the trampoline to her car Fm: OH F\*\*\* NO!!!! Fm gets a broom and pushes them out of the backyard and locks the backyard gate. The end and thanks for reading!! :D
