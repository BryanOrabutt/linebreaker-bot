So I’m a guy and in college and in the fall semester I met one of my roommates friends while we were out and I thought she was really cute. So time went on and never saw her out again except maybe like one more time during the fall semester and we said hi and nothing really came of it. Fast forward to this semester maybe 3 weeks ago she is out with my roommate and goes up to him complimenting me yet again saying “He’s a pretty boy” and even asked if he was going out that night and if I was going to be there. So he told her yes and she said okay let me know where you guys go and i’ll meet you and that night she came out alone which I assume was because I was there. While at the bar she brought up her formal and i jokingly said if you need a date i got you and she seemed actually to be on board with it and agreed. Fast forward two weeks and it’s my birthday and she snapped me saying Happy Birthday and she couldn’t wait to go to her formal. The formal comes around later in the week and with everything going on with the coronavirus in the US right now she tells me she’s leaving school in a few weeks to go home. Since this is my last year in school too I decided I should just tell her I have a little crush on her just to let it be known. So I did and she said the same thing she thinks I’m really cute and I brought up hanging out before she leaves and she seemed on board. Then few days pass after the formal and I ask our mutual friend if she said anything and he’s like “She said she had a fun time and that you told her you had a crush and she didn’t know how to react. So being an extremely pessimistic overthinker i assumed the worst and assumed she didn’t feel the same if she says she didn’t know how to react or she was genuinely caught off guard. Yesterday I snapchatted her asking if she wanted to get dinner on campus before she leaves since she was leaving today and she responded that she would’ve loved to but was having a goodbye party for her sorority sisters and said it would’ve been nice to hang and sucks this all had to happen. Reason i’m asking for this advice on all this is cause i overthink so much and today i sent her two snaps and she let both of them on read and never sent another one and I assumed she was trying to let our streak end and just felt like now that she left school she’s not interested anymore but I just wanted outside opinions. Just not sure if she’s already disinterested when 3 weeks ago she literally spoke highly of me and took me as her date to her formal. Sorry if I seem like an idiot with this dumb question 😂
