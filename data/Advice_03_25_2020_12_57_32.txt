So I moved out with my best friend from high school about 9 months ago, he's basically family and kinda adopted into mine, hes been there in the best and the worst of times and ive done the same, we've been talking about moving out for a while and I lost my job due to some bullshit and have 1 check and no car, my friend had a car and knew someone for cheap rent, we said fuck it and moved, first few months were good, we both got a dog and jobs, my roommate got a girlfriend and about after 4 months of dating and 1 breakup she was kicked out on short notice and had nowhere to go, my roommate lost his job and she had one, struggling to pay rent I was kinda forced into it and she moved in temporarily, when we first moved in my roommate took the actual room and I was stuck with the living room/ kitchen that was next to the bathroom and led to the front door and having dogs there was just no privacy, when my roommates girl moved in she had a dog and took in another cause it was abused, my room not having a door except the front door the dogs are always in my room tearing shit up cause their puppies so my shit gets destroyed and not his, ive gone through 2 beds and a couch and my current one is a little chewed up and that's just where I sleep, so we got 4 dogs and 3 people in a small ass place, their whole relationship is either fighting, yelling and having sex, its not a good relationship and not long ago it got really bad like borderline domestic abuse, not far enough to call police but could of easily escalated to it, that day I worked 10 hours and had a breakup at work and come home to them fighting, they burst into my room/kitchen and start to get a little physical, they trashed my room and spilt a half of a half gal of vodka on the floor but the next day made up, they never bothered to say anything about it to me, about a month ago I met this girl, as someone who has a hard time with women and haven't had many relationships and all of them were like really bad situations and no one on dating apps really hold a conversation or whatever and I met this one and we hit it off pretty well, we have alot in common and she's a nerd like me who watches anime does cosplays and dnd and video games and pretty cute, its pretty hard to come by girls like those and ones that actually like me back and one I feel like I can trust or be with for a while and actually have a decent relationship for once, she's just perfect but we are very alike and been through some shit as well, about a week ago some shit happened and she got kicked out of her house, she's been on the streets since and with the quarantine its rough out there and its been cold and rainy and I feel bad for her cause I'm sorta in a tweaker town and shes not like that but unfortunately has nowhere to go and has managed to get by, wanting to hangout since at this point we both like each other and she was about 10 minutes out and it was my last day off that week and she was trying to get a ride out here, while video chatting she said her ride might be there and hung up, me thinking her ride was there but her phone died I wasnt sure, on a whim I walked to our meeting point about 2 maybe 3 miles one way, I got there and she wasnt there, she never got a ride from her friend and it was for nothing but I needed go get out the house anyway, after working almost 4 10 hour days at work we finally hangout at my house after bribing my roommate 20 bucks I luckily found on the ground since im broke as well and the only one working due to my roommate not finding a job after months and his girl losing hers to the virus and can barely get by as it was, she comes over and of course in love with my puppy, they maul her at the door all playfully and one barking cause its a new person, they calm down and she's just focused on my dog still, my roommate takes all the dogs in his room and kinda stays in there like a bro, then my girl wanted to pet my dog so I asked if they could let her out and they said no, confused on why I couldnt see my own dog I thought there must be a good reason then my roommate said that my girl had to leave in like 2 hours all of a sudden when she was suppose to stay the night, we were both very sad in the fact he was kicking her out on the streets and that she had to leave and that she had to be in the cold and rain and possibly get arrested because of the quarantine and that she couldnt have a night with shelter, food and cuddles and she cried, we drop her off where we picked her up and crying on her way out and down the street and in the car my roommate finally speaks on the situation, this guy said that she couldn't stay because him and his girl thought she was hurting the dogs and that the dog's dont like her when in reality they heard a yip from their room when there was no yip, I was in the room and would of known if something happened to the dogs, my dog was playing with her and my roommates dog didn't mind her but she mostly wanted to pet my dog and that was why I could see my dog, I explained this to my roommate but he didnt care, he said she was crazy based off of like 1 conversation with her, his one red flag he mentioned was the fact she would look at me all cutely and say meow or grr and he referred to it as furry crap which it really isn't and she does it because she has anxiety and its calms her down a little, he even compared her to my toxic ex who is just a horrible person honestly and did some shit and still currently trying to ruin my life and trying to get me fired from my job for no reason pretty much, for something I didnt even do, he said she couldnt come over and that I had to go to her house, I told him she got kicked out a week ago and its been rough and he laughed and said get fucked I dont give a shit, my girls not crazy but someone u gotta get to know maybe, she's got depression, anxiety and adhd and maybe a little bipolar but who isn't a little depressed and has some anxiety and I grew up not to judge people off the bat, I can tell she's not gonna be fucked up like my past relationships, this ones different and I really do like her so this situation pains me more, since she left I havent been able to sleep at all, its 5am and inside a nice warm place but I'm missing something important my girl and while I'm sitting here I look outside and worry about her and her safety and comfort and I just know its rough out there for her, I told my friend from back home about the whole situation and he knows everything that's been happening since ive moved and he thinks its fucked up and he's in the wrong, he offered later in the summer to drive down and pick me up and my girl if everything goes well to move in with him near where I use to live and I know i could live with him cause I basically did at one point and he's a respectful and loyal person and a good guy and I know I won't have as many problems if any but I also dont wanna abandon my friend as much as I'm mad at him rn and its rough thinking about moving because I dont have much cash due to the virus and the only one here with a job and I dont have a car so ill have to get one before or soon after I move, ive had to pay my roommates ticket he got and insurance and registration since he drives me to work and he doesnt have money and I'm in a little debt with him that I need to pay back, the debt is from the move here and he helped me build a kick ass magic the gathering deck, I wanna move and maybe it will be better but i don't wanna lose a close friend and a brother pretty much, I just want us to all be friends because I know they can get along because shes so much like me and me and my roommate enjoy doing nerd stuff and so does she, I honestly have no clue what to do, life's been rough since I moved and I feel like I'm always getting the shit end of the stick especially since I spent all night after a 9 hour shift at 12am cleaning the house cause dogs reck it and just other stuff and spent all morning till like 5 after little sleep to clean more and fix a door my roommates broke when I was at work to make the house nice for her and to impress her a little and on top of things of unfairness my roommate and his girl are adding another girl I dont know into their relationship and spending the night after they kick out my girl over bullshit and I know I'm gonna spend all day sad and depressed about everything while all 3 of them lock themselves in their room and fuck all day like several hours, I have paper thin walls and its alot louder than my tv turned the fuck up, I never get sleep in my house in general cause of either dogs, sunlight, me being a natural night owl or them waking me up by talking because their loud people so I'm just tired from work and them and her living here and lack of sleep and the bullshit, my friend from home said that in getting pushed around and have no say at the house and its just some fucked shit, does anyone have any advice on what to do, I dont see things getting too much better and Idk how to see this girl that I really like and spend time with her anymore, I dont want to lose her and I want it to work and hes not making it easy at all, I just cant seem to catch a break or be with someone who actually makes me happy for once and I know i make her happy too
