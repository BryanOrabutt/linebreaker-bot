Hey all.. I’m 31.. I’m not really sure what the proper abbreviations are... lol.. I’m female and I’m the one with the higher libido.. except mine isn’t high, it’s just there as opposed to his non existent one.. so we have been together for 9 years and we might have sex once every 3 months.. so maybe 4 times a year 🤨....at first I would initiate and now I don’t at all because I’m scared of the rejection... I used to think he was cheating and I would search his phone and I would usually always find him talking to another girl.. so the possibility that he is cheating is still there..🤷🏼‍♀️.. bottom line is that I have dealt with this for so long... quietly, because the couple times I mentioned it to someone they were like “what, my husband and I have sex once a week” and then I just feel more like shit..... i honestly cant remember the last time we kissed.. the really annoying part is that when we’re with close friends he tries to act like he’s such a sexual guy.. like he will make jokes or slap my ass.. all this does is piss me off.. or like today he just came up to me and grabbed my breast in a really rough way and was like “those are mine” and he actually hurt me.. I was thinking in my head like not really cause you don’t ever use them 🤦🏼‍♀️.... I’ve been looking into these dating apps... and picturing finding someone.. but I really don’t like the idea of cheating.. I did it once with my sons biological father in the beginning of the relationship because even then we weren’t having sex and I was kinda thinking of just getting back with my ex, especially cause I found messages of my partner trying to meet his ex on my birthday. and I felt like complete shit for cheating, even though it may have been justifiable, so since then I have been faithful but I honestly feel like if he can’t have sex with me then I should be allowed to find it elsewhere, I feel this so much so that I have actually asked him how he feels about seeing other people and he gets so pissed.. I’ve warned him that I’m not happy.. 2 years ago I enrolled back in school to finish my bachelors because I want to be able to support my kids without him.. and now I’m almost done and I told him if things don’t change I’m buying a house with my mom and she will help me with the kids.. do you think he’s made an effort... no!!! Now he falls asleep in the living room while playing call of duty every night.. and I literally never get to see him cause he’s a detective so you would think the time he is here he would want to be with me but Nope... sorry for the long post, I’m just literally at my wits end with this whole thing.. today is Valentine’s Day.. the worst day for me.. I can’t remember the last time we celebrated.. so I will go on social media apps and see post about what everyone’s significant other gave them and I will just enjoy my Valentine’s Day with some red wine and some chocolates that I will be buying for myself 🤷🏼‍♀️
