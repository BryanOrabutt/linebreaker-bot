Pretty much the title, 2019 was probably the worst year of my 26 years, best friend of 14 years and girlfriend of 5 left me February 2019, lost my job In January last year as well, I’ve just been working small jobs every few days for the past year, I have no motivation, no determination, no future it seems, sure there’s things I’d like to accomplish of course but I can’t seem to pick myself up, I dont even want to go outside to look for a job because I’m just to anxious, my mind is always racing’s 24/7 so I smoke weed to not think, I used to be addicted to Xanax for the same reason, anxiety but mainly because my mind was always going at 100mphs and the Xanax would pretty much stop all those thoughts, I’ve been clean a year now and I’m much better off but I just can’t find a job especially since I have hand and neck tattoos, I never used to have trouble and I always worked up until last year, I feel like I’m just hovering over my body watching myself do nothing, letting myself slowly fade away, I always have thoughts “I know I’m going to die early” “I know I’ll probably only live for another few years”..I’ve also decided to go back to college but I need a job first and if I can’t even find one and push myself for that then I know I won’t last in school, I just feel hopeless, lost and stuck, it really hurts, I feel like I’m not really here anymore, I don’t have any friends anymore being as most of them were fake and bad influences anyways, I have 1 -2 friends but we don’t really even hangout that much, I know a lot of people but don’t consider them friends cause I know how they are, I’ve just closed myself off so much that I feel like I can’t come back, from family and other people, just nothing seems to go right and I haven’t caught a break at all, I don’t really expect one but I guess it’s just be nice, I don’t really feel like myself anymore, I really just don’t know who I even am anymore. It’s the worst kind of feeling.
