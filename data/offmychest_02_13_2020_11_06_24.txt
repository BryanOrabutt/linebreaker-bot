I’m 20 and a male, I don’t know exactly how to explain my situation but I really need to let people know because I feel so alone and invisible all the time. Most of high school I was extremely shy and reserved, I had hardly any friends but that was probably my fault for not talking to anyone. I graduated high school and took a gap year overseas where I worked in a factory job to save up some money. I stayed with family and didn’t really make any close friends while I was there. Looking back now I find it weird that sometimes I can’t get out of bed in the morning but I travelled across the earth by myself at 18. Anyways when I came home from my gap year I spent the whole next year doing absolutely nothing and I didn’t have a single friend. The only people I talked to on a daily basis where my Mum, Dad and brother. Now it’s 2020 and I have just started University/college and I am still very shy and reserved even though I spent a year overseas in a unfamiliar environment. I haven’t talked to anyone at University because everyone knows someone in their class or at least at the campus. This rarely happens but whenever I go out to the movies or just into the city to walk around I see all these groups of friends or couples laughing and smiling together and I become so overwhelmingly upset because I have never ever experienced that, and it seems so nice to have people who like you and are always there for you no matter what. I think something is wrong with me because whenever I think about what it would be like to have a group friends I get so anxious and I overthink to the point that I'd convince myself that no matter how much fun friends seemed to have around me, if they weren't constantly reaching out to me and telling me how much they enjoy my time, I'd be convinced that they were just dealing with me, and secretly found me to be a huge waste of time and energy. I’m sorry if this is extremely long and boring, I just had to get it off my chest.
