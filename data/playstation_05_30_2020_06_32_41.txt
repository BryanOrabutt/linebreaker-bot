I know there are probably LOTS of posts similar to this one of people trying to get their account unbanned but i manage a destiny 2 community called "Destiny 2" ( has a red destiny 2 logo as the community picture ) it currently has 61,285 people in it, so i often get messages from people telling me that there are people misbehaving in the community so i go and check it out to see if the person needs a warning or if it results in banning them from the community, Last night i got a message from a fellow saying that a guy was being very vulgar in the community and if i went to check it out I'd see why so of course i went to go see what was going on and there was a guy posting vulgar images of his private area in the community, Obviously this results in an instant ban so i deleted the post and i always message people to let them know that they're banned and why, so after i deleted the post i started to message him, i simply said "Banned." because obviously this guy knows that what he did was wrong and he proceeds to be racist toward me and say "no ban n-" I'm not gonna finish that sentence, you can figure what he said and so after that he sends 3 vulgar images to me in DMs, one being the one he sent in the community of his private area, one being one of a girl's body being sliced up and out in the grass, and another of homosexual images on his web browser, i reported him for all of this and i didn't reply but hours later I wake up to an email saying that MY account was banned for "Offensive or abusive content or abuse directed at others." I would understand if i had sent those images or if I'd said something rude or offensive but I haven't, i normally avoid being hot headed after I'd been suspended once before. so if there's someone out there that can help me or someone out there that works for PSN please contact me I'd be ever so grateful, I've tried contacting customer support but all they say is that PSN bans can't be lifted even though i know they can, my girlfriend's account was banned and the ban on that was lifted and my best friend's account had been banned before and that was also lifted, please contact me as soon as possible it would be much appreciated **:)**.
