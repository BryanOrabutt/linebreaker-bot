This whole thing is my opinion but no one gives two shits if your movie is sad or some shit. I don’t care. I don’t feel good when the happy ending comes at the end but I just feel like “Oh wow couldn’t have seen that one coming.” When 90% of the movie is sad and gloomy, with the main character just getting knocked down and down again, it’s not fun to watch. I get that the person watching is supposed to feel sympathetic but it’s just outright boring. At first it’s fine, you feel the emotions that your supposed to, but if you don’t include at least a slight positive, then the viewer expects everything that comes next. USE SOME FUCKING ORIGINALITY. When you’ve watched one of these movies, you’ve watched them all. Unless some crazy shit happens, it is not amusing whatsoever. The ending comes and 99 out of 100 times it’s a happy one and the problem is solved and the remaining 10 minutes of the movie are filled with joy but that’s the problem. A regular length movie is around 90 minutes long. Only 11% of the movie is happy and fun. Imagine if you had a bag of popcorn, but 89% of the popcorn was overdone? Would you enjoy this? But we have to make sure to have at least some burnt popcorn or else you won’t appreciate the rest of the good popcorn, a good amount would be about 20% burnt. In a movie, it’s ok to bump the number up to around 40%-60% because I can admit that the same thing would happen the other way around too if you had too happy of a movie but that very rarely happens. And it’s even more important to spread this out evenly, if you have it all at the end, the viewer knows exactly what will happen because it’s just a copy of hundreds of other movies and you’ve basically already watched this. Have some happiness in the middle to keep the watcher interested because this rarely happens and what you think will be an ordinary movie turns out the be different than you expected. If you have read this far then you deserve a cookie, but I’m all out so yeah.
