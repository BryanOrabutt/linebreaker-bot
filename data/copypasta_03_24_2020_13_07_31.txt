 After the DawnGuard quest, I married Serana in Skyrim. She is the worst wife that I could have chosen. She won't even walk into the kitchen that I have constructed at Heljarchen Hall. She won't offer me a "Homecooked Meal" no matter what I do.  It's like the bitch never cooked a meal in her life or something. I mean, she stands there... stirring the pot like she knows her way around a good Horker loaf, but then... nothing! It was all just for show. A tease.  And that's not all. No matter how much gold or how many jewels I bring back, Serana is **never** satisfied.  The Hearthfires are never lit. You know how much real estate I own?  I got cribs in every city in Skyrim but even though the Dragonborn brings home the booty... I never get any booty at my home.  In Morthal? Riften? It doesn't matter.  Sometimes, the Dhovakiin needs his sword "enchanted", know what I'm sayin'? And I don't wanna hear about no *Arrow in da knee* or about no *Dragon Porn*, neither. That's not the worst of it. After a hard day spent fighting Draugr or the Dragon Priests, you know what Serana asks me?  *Did you stop by Radiant Raiments and pick up those shoes I wanted?*  HELL NO!  Like the Dhovakiin needs that kind of shit. I just saved the world from being drowned in fire, bitch! And after all of that, all you want to know is *Did you pick up my shoes from Solitude?*  You think I want to deal with those uppity Radiant Raiment skanks again, right after I fought every pointy eared prick at the Thalmore Embassy?  I **might** want to rethink my outfit? I am a Thane of Whiterun, bitch! YOU might want to rethink your **attitude** before I put my boot up your ass!  Nothing is ever good enough for Serana. It's because her daddy spoiled her so much when she was young. I bring home a Shield Brother for a Nord Ale or two after we've had a hard day murdering Frost Trolls in the Pale. It's always the same shit: Serana's eyes light up, she's all like *Goody! You brought home dinner!*  Now my mother-in-law's a bloodsucking bitch. My father-in-law hates me. He wants to murder me because I ruined his plans to turn off the sun and rule the world. **One time!**  My poor foster kids... they're always nervous.  They walk around like they're treading on Chaurus Eggs.  And when it's time to get Serana out of all that tight leather? Time to play? No! Whenever I feel even the slightest bit romantic after a hard day of bandit killing, Serana tells me: *I don't think that's for us.*  Or even worse yet: *Anything would be better than this.*  You know what I should've done? I should've stuck with that ginger from Whiterun.  The chick with the freaky face paint?  The one that I met at my first Giant fight. I've always liked redheads. I'll bet she's a real animal in the sack. I'm telling you, Aela from Jorrvaskr would have made one great Companion!
