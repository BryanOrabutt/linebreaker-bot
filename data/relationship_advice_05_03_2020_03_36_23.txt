So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female "friend" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with. Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend "more" time with this "friend" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat" and being a bitch to me yet again. Moral of the story, I have no clue how to deal with her, I have been suffering with her like this for a good couple of years now, and even then it doesnt clean up the fact that she did some horrible and selfish things that ended up hurting me in the end all throughout my life, I have a bunch of undiagnosed mental problems, and can't get help even after she found out that I harm, and I have no fucking idea how I'm supposed to stand this type of thing for another couple of years before I could at least move or leave the  country.
