Hi! My name is Lexi... I know Iâ€™m not a parent, but I want to reach out to some people that may be understanding because I am a human who genuinely needs help. I am 17 years old, almost 18. I live with my dad who is a single father raising me by himself since I was two years old. My mom is completely out of the picture and doesnâ€™t help support me at all. My dad and I are on our own. I started working at 15 years old to help support my dad because we have struggled for as long as I can remember. Two days before my 17th birthday we got evicted from our apartment. For six months we were homeless moving in and out of peoples houses no one really wanted to help us including our own family. Last weekend we finally were able to move into a one bedroom apartment in a more dangerous area of our state. With covid I lost my job and I was no longer able to help my dad for almost two months, I just started a new job a few days ago. I am thrilled to be back working. but the only issue is my job is 20 minutes away from where we live and I have to take three different buses in order to get to my job. I am only 17 I am very small only 5 feet even and I am scared to be by myself at night on the bus because I am not in a safe area. I have been trying to save for a car since I first started working, but since I am constantly having to help pay for bills and rent I am being set back. I am asking for a little bit of support, if 2900 people send me 1$ I will be able to get a car. I am usually not one to ask people for money, but I genuinely need help. If you want to reach out and send me help private message me and I can give you my venmo or cash app. Even if you donâ€™t help me financially I would love a prayer or some advice. These last few years have been tough for me and I would love and appreciate anyone who reaches out! Thank you for your time reading thisðŸ’—
