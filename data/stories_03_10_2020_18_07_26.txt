I can remember it vividly as I was just 4 then but I remember a man with my dad talking and there was thus little girl much younger than me, I remembered him leaving the girl crying and more than once I heard my parents telling her your dad will soon come back, we became bestfriends and though she was 2 years younger than me, I think our friendship was what made her soon  forget about her dad or Atleast not ask about him all the time. I didn’t know she was my cousin then I wasn’t told, so I just thought she was a girl living with us. My mom told me her dad told them he would be back to pick her up in 2 weeks but they never saw him till 4 years later. The day I saw him, I wanted to go and tell my cousin her dad was back but he started leaving and I decided not to get her hopes up. She was always getting in fights, causing trouble, it’s like nothing could please her and soon her mom decided to take her from us. She went to live with our grandparents, that didn’t last long because they said she was too much trouble so she went to stay with one of my aunts, that also didn’t last long, then she went to stay with her step mom, that didn’t go well because her stepmom didn’t want to take care of her anymore and once  again her dad brought her back to our house, she stayed with us for a couple of years then she moved in with a different aunt, she stayed there for a few months until her mom who was at that time living with us began to suspect something was up, I was 10 at the time and I remembered the whole incident clearly. She kept telling my parents something was wrong with her daughter and my parents kept telling her she shouldn’t worry my aunt is a really nice woman and would take good care of her daughter but when my aunt realized no one was taking her seriously she decided to pay my aunt a suprise visit they lived in a different town, when she got in as she says the first thing is heard was her daughter scream, she immediately ran inside the house to look for where her daughter was, then she heard my aunts husband saying so you want to steal from us, I will cut off your arms today, she opened the door and she found my aunts husband holding a big knife and my cousin’s hand like he was about to cut it and my cousin crying, my aunt said she couldn’t believe her eyes. My cousin looked like she had not eaten in weeks she lost so much weight, she had bruises all over her body, she couldn’t even stand on her own, she was that week, that day she brought my cousin back to our house and everyone heard about it and for years no one in our family was talking to that aunt of her husband and my cousin wouldn’t talk about the incident with anybody, I guess she was to traumatized to talk about it. I wanted to know badly but I didn’t want to push it but one day she finally told me what happened, she said her aunt and her husband left her home after she had came back to school they told her not to go anywhere till they were back but she decided to go out and play she was 8 at the time, while she was playing a man came up to her and told her that she should I bring all her parents jeweries and money and when she told him she was living with her aunt he told her to go and bring everything or he would kill her and her aunt so she did what he said and when her aunt came back and saw all their money and jeweries where gone, her husband accused my cousin of stealing and locked her up in a room for days he wasn’t feeding her and he would only go into the room when he felt like beating her, his daughter felt bad and she started feeding her through the window but when he found out he got angry and beat his daughter badly so his daughter stopped trying to feed her. She later says one thing she is dying to know is why he treated her so badly but she hates him to much to ask. Then a few years later another conversation came up about why she was always acting up and causing through as a kid and she said she only did it because she felt like no one actually wanted her and all she wanted was to be with her dad so she thought if she caused trouble wherever she was sent to her dad would have to take her back and even though people told her her dad was a bad person she didn’t care, she just wanted to be with him and she was jealous that everyone got to stay with their parents but she couldn’t because neither wanted to stay with her, her dad was with her older brother and her sister was with her mom all the time but she was the only one changing homes ever few months or years. I haven’t seen my cousin in months and this is thanks to my step mom, her mom also forbid her from coming to our house there was a big incident about drugs and my sister and who taught who. It was just stupid but my sister got most of the blame and even though I like my cousin a lot I thought it was wrong for her to lie just so she would look innocent, they are banned from seeing or talking to each other but they meet in private whenever they get the chance they just can’t be seen together by anyone in our family, she is currently in college so she doesn’t have to live with anybody, she stays in an apartment with a friend of her. I’m guessing her life is going well and I probably will text her today because it’s been long we spoke.
