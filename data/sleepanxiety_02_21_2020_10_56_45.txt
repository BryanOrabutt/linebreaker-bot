to start i’ve lived in the same house sleeping in the same room my whole life, but the past few months have been hell trying to sleep at night. I can’t help but feel.. watched. ilike there’s an overwhelming presence watching me in my room I hear tapping in my closet and on my walls and all around and it’s bugs me the fuck out. it’s almost 6 am and i’ve been up with anxiety this whole time im so tired i just want to sleep so bad. i’ve been sleeping with the tv on because the silence also really freaks me out because i can hear every little noise. even when i’m watching i’ll doze off and feel a touch on my face or body and jolt awake and sit up for HOURS. i’ll also see white blurs out of the corner of my eye and when i look it’s gone. my cat sleeps with me every night and she always is looking all around the room at nothing, even now she’s perched at the edge of my bed staring at my closet. the only time I can sleep well is if i’m next to someone, or if I go to sleep while my parents are still up so around 9 or 10, but even then i end up waking up at 3am laying awake. for the past several months for the most part I’m so freaked out I just stay awake until the sun comes up. I can’t live like this anymore, I’ve tried saging my room and whole house, i’ve tried melatonin and trazodone nothing works and it’s really taking a toll on me and my sleep schedule it’s come to the point where I just don’t feel comfortable in my own room at night and it kills me. I don’t know what to do anymore I just wanna cry I need to be an adult and fkn do things but this is just debilitating. idk if this is the place to talk about this or if there’s a more I guess paranormal reddit page someone could recommend but I really need some help if someone could please give me some advice or something I really need it and would appreciate it.
