I don’t even know where to start.. I met this girl who is amazing that I’ve been talking to/FaceTiming 24/7 for the past 5 months.. I met her a year ago but we started to constantly stay on FaceTime starting then.. we both talked about a long distance relationship and we knew it would be difficult but we still wanted to at least try. It’s been great.. there’s just one thing. Her parents.. I can’t express how much frustration I have for them.. basically when we first met. We were texting and she said something along the lines of “The name buddy sounds like we’re just friends, what other name should we use ;)” and I was stupid but also comfortable enough at the time and I just said “I have no idea because I call everyone buddy, are you thinking f*%k buddy or something?” Censored and everything.. I was 16 at the time and I realize it was a mistake. I’ve tried everything.. her parents are the biggest children on the planet and we both didn’t know that they were tracking all of their phones and could read their messages. Her dads verbally abusive and her mom.. she’s decent I guess but I have treated her with nothing but with the most upmost respect since day one and I bought her medicine because her mom couldn’t even get up and take her to the store to get some. Without this.. we would’ve probably already met physically. Her parents are painting me out to be a killer over one dumb 3 word sentence and I’m sick of it.. they treat all of their children like they’re servants and don’t do crap for themselves. When this first happened I swallowed my pride and texted her mom and tried to apologize.. nope wasn’t good enough. Instead i “Shot my self in the head at the end of the text” because I just said how I wished she would’ve contacted me first if she had a problem with me because they think they can just have my phone/state I live in/name and still not have the balls to even text me. I’m so sick of jumping through these hoops. They say I’m not a “good influence” but the next day let her hang out with her friend who’s not a good influence that’s actually THERE.. I’ve had to listen to her cry because they can’t act like adults and her mom is too much of a pansy to protect her kids and she just lets it happen so he doesn’t get more mad and have his little temper tantrum. Sorry if this was all over the place but I’ve been holding this in for a year. 😅
