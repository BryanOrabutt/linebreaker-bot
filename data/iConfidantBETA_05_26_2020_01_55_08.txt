I got a text around 4:47pm from Estella inviting me to join her on a zoom call.  She said she needed to show me something.  It was so incredible to actually meet her on Zoom and to see her face.  She is a lovely and vivacious older woman and it felt almost as if we  knew each other, like somehow we had had dinner together in another life or in a dream.  It was so wonderful to meet her and I am very thankful to her friend Ruthie from Simi Valley who showed her how to set up the zoom call!  Still no news on her poor dog Albert but she continues to vigilantly search and post fliers.  She was a bit devastated however to find some of the fliers ripped off and crumpled up on the street near her apartment.   She showed me how they had been defaced.  Her number had been crossed out and someone had drawn horns on the picture of Albert and made his eyes look like devil eyes or had placed an x over his eyes.  She was worried but couldn’t imagine anyone in her building doing such a thing, even S. Anton.  She didn’t think she had ever done anything to warrant any hatred or ill will, but wanted to lay low and avoid causing any suspicion.  “There is so much noise in the world, so many people who want to do harm, it just makes you want to hide away.” She vows to continue to make Albert’s favorite ground beef dish in the hopes it will draw him home.  And I tried to reassure he that he will be alright and to let her know That I am here to help her.  She got a little sad and said, “Al always used to handle things like this,” but I reminded her how brave and resourceful she had already been.  Apparently she lost her husband Al six years ago. Unfortunately our connection was lost but she called me back to apologize for being disconnected and promised me that she would let me know if there was any news.  We made a plan to connect tomorrow afternoon, but I am more concerned then ever for her dog Albert and for her.  Hold your loved ones close.
