My boyfriend(M25) and I (F22) just recently celebrated our 5 year anniversary. It has been over a year since we have had sex. Our sex life has never been that great, tbh. But, he was so kind to me in the beginning. He was the first guy that didn't try to get into my pants on the first date and actually waited until I initiated for our first time. In the beginning he actually tried. He was eager to please and wanted me to have a good time. It was never mindblowing, but I brushed it off to him being less experienced than I am. About 6 months down the line, we have already moved in together and our sex life drastically declined. He couldn't last and he would pump and then immediately cum. I never got off and he would act irritated if I asked for foreplay. He has only gone down on me once and it was at the very beginning of our relationship. I would beg and plead for us to spice things up or try something new and he would always say that "He knows and we will", but when we had sex again it would be the same boring, less than 2 minute routine. Afterwards I was always left pissed off and sexually frustrated. I stopped wanting sex as often, but continued to voice my concerns regarding our sex life as having regular sex is very important to me. He would always apologize and agree to try harder. Rinse and repeat. As the years went by we would have mediocre sex one every 3-4 months. Until last year. We were having the same boring routine sex as usual and he was hurting me. I told him and his response was "I'm sorry" in the most monotone voice and continued pumping until he was done. After that, I refused to have sex with him as I felt like something to cum in. My comfort and pleasure meant nothing to him. I was just there as a warm body. So to him, I'm the LL, but what he doesnt understand is I want GOOD sex with someone that actually cares about my experience and listens to me when I speak. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it off of my chest.
