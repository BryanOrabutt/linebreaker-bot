I voted for independence  in 2014 and remember being absolutely  crushed when we never got it , although back then i wasn't politically minded  i felt brow beaten into it by my parents who were absolute  die hard snp supporters . But that was my kind of political awakening  in the brexit referendum  i didnt vote as i had a mixed view  of things and i know thats my fault for not doing the research but i was still only dipping my toes into politics , but over the years i have grown largely to dislike the snp and they're  policies , i still wish for an independent  Scotland  just not under snp rule  and without being dictated to by the eu . But that is why this is an unpopular opinion  your either in 1 of 2 camps you're  either with the snp and have everyone ridicule you for wanting to vote anything else unless your a unionist and are considered right wing and  to be discounted . Which in lies my problem i find myself leaning more to what i think is just the common sense approach  of the conservatives  anti  eu , scrapping the tv licence fee  and pushing the bbc into the free market , and  controlling immigration due to the social strife its causing , overpopulation , infistructure unable to keep up large portions of them not intigrating into society  etc , and with the new migrant crisis beginning due to turkey im glad were no longer  mandated by the eu to do anything about it , thats a humanitarian crisis waiting to happen with the spread of covid 19  and uncontrolable hoards of people moving through europe with no access to medical care . Some may see it as cruel for me to say this but we done our fair share last time our resources aren't  infinite and charity begins at home . With  the snp now giving away free sanitary products aswell as considering free transport for young people free higher education to our own and people from other countries aswell  and free prescritptions , which i use btw due to a lifelong skin condition  before someone accuses me of not knowing what its like . Im not coming at this from a position of privilege  either im just a lowely shop worker as is my S.O and we get by just fine . Probably going to be crucified  for this but idk thats my piece
