So I'm Bi, 24, Male, and had my first real experience with a woman a few days ago. She was really shy and quiet, so I assumed she wanted a real date. She quickly wanted to bail on the date to go "watch movies" at my place. We're cuddling, I tried several times to create moments to start making out but couldn't tell from her body language if I should. Finally she made a shift as I could tell she was ready. Making out led to foreplay, I think I'm decent at this part, and I started eating her pussy. Right away I knew it was going to be a challenge. Because of her body shape I wasn't able to breath and was trying to find a good angle but had to stop frequently. We do this for awhile, I know I'm not that good, I tried ask the methods I read about online trying to figure out what she likes. I got some squirms and moans but clearly nothing orgasmic. She asks if I have a condom. I do. The problem is I already know I'm not getting hard again. I had been so focused on doing my job I had gone totally soft. My confidence was low already. I figured I had to reset, maybe lay back and let her suck me a bit or at least play with my nipple or something, anything really. But she was not into it. After a couple licks of my dick she asked me to finger her. I did my best but I was definitely too jabby. I could tell she wasn't enjoying it. She said she was ready to be done, I agreed. Nether of us finished. We cuddled a bit, made out a bit more. Goodnight kiss, she leaves. I didn't expect to hear from her again but she's still into me. Cut to today she's in urgent care for a UTI during all this great COVID shit. Actually it turns out she's very afraid of hospitals. I said, I felt guilty because it's definitely my fault . She said it was worth it, and even wants to meet up again. I don't find her especially attractive but I'd really like to redeem myself and learn, but I'm also terrified of wasting yet another night of her life and further hurting my confidence.
