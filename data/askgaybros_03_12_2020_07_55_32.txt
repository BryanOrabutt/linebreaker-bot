# So im 23 m and I met this guy on tinder (23 too) in November, we went on a date, it was great! Great conversation, no awkward silences we both laughed a lot. A couple of weeks went by, we were both busy with college and finals and all of the sudden it was December. We both replied to our insta storys and texted on and off on break. On January, I went on vacation abroad, we talked on seeing each other again as soon as I got back from the trip. Long story short, we finally got to meet again this week for lunch. As in the first date, everything went great, he is so handsome and fun to talk to, and I feel confortable with him, its like going for lunch with an old friend, and that's the thing, we don't flirt much. I think we haven't flirted at all really. We talk about family and our careers and movies and books, but we haven't talked about what we are looking for or what we are into or any of that stuff. After the date, when we said good bye, we hugged and he told me "until next time" and I got that as a "there's going to be a third date then". Afterward I texted him that I had a great time, he told me he had a great time too! I suggested for us to go see a movie from a film festival that's happening next week and he was in. Currently we are planing on what movie and what day works for us both. He is a med student so his free time is limited and we don't really text much because he is always busy and I understand. So do I like him? is he just shy? He doesn't have much experience dating guys? (he is still closeted with his family) How do I ask him what he feels without being too forward or intense? Am I being too needy? I don't know lol, I mean Im just so confused because im really into him and I feel this might work but he doesn't show he is into me but still agrees on keep going on dates so idk help
