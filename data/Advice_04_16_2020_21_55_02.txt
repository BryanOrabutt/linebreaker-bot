I met my boyfriend February of 2017 and his daughter was 16 months old then. We got pretty close, she and i. She'd even crawl into my lap to cuddle. We got pregnant very quickly and during my pregnancy I grew this anger towards her. I did step out of place in terms of disciplining her and very late, like this year, put myself back in place. I do not spank her I strictly use time out and take say TV or play time away. Again it's late and I know I was in the wrong I've apologized to her but she's 4 and in my opinion not neurotypical so I don't think she really got what I was saying. Im a yeller. I yell a lot. They don't listen the first few times im trying to get around and away from it but it's frustrating. Half the day I care for them by myself bc my bf works nights. I try and try but I can see where im harsh on her. I tend to just want her to sit down and shut up but I know that's fucked up. My son is 2 now and heavily attached to my mom. I know I dont treat them the same. I don't even want to kiss or hug her. I love her I feed them the same healthy meals. I know she doesn't like meat very much so I serve her more veggies. I care when she goes to the doctors. I suggested we get ensure type drink to help her gain weight cause she's on the small side for her age. I know she's lactose intolerant. I understand what she says more than anyone. I see her more than her own dead beat mom. But I feel like I've because I second dead beat mom because how badly I treat her. This isn't even about me and my bf arguing I guess bc I know im wrong. What do I do when I can't afford therapy and sending her to her mom's isn't an option on either side. I don't want to send her away either. I just want to take back the anger I grew and love my first baby again. Im scared we won't ever get back there and I don't know what to do. I scare her I can see it anyone can see it
