Hiyas I'm looking for some advice.  My son came home from college and moved in with my mum a couple of miles away from me.  I noticed even in high school my son was addicted to gaming but my hope was when he went to college he would overcome this.  Unfortunately that didn't happen because my mum help him with all his college work so he continued to play. Now he's back from college and has spent the last two years in a dark bedroom at my mum's house playing video games and working a very part-time job of less than 20 hours a week. He has become completely antisocial and gets so agitated if we dare to try to talk to him.  My mum makes all his food and he eats in his room. He only showers when he has to go to his job.    I have been trying to get him to apply for some type of internship at a production company because he majored in film but he refuses to do anything. The problem is my mum doesn't see that he has this addiction. She thinks that everything is okay and he will eventually get out on his own. I know that is impossible because of how this is affecting his life.  I am blown away that she does not see how big does problem is but she doesn't so I'm looking to see if anyone has any advice on how I can convince my mum that he has this addiction and get her to work with me to help him. She says that she would never throw him out  (she pays all his bills right) but I feel that she could do other things like say she doesn't allow gaming in the house or only allow the internet to be on for a couple hours a day just to do something to help him to break this habit.  I just don't know how to get her to see how bad this addiction is and how badly it's ruining his life. I have been crying for weeks watching him like this. He was such a smart loving boy who had looked forward to his future and watching it all slip away is breaking my heart.  If anyone has any advise please let me know.  Thank you.
