 That's incorrect. The Quantum Eraser/Delayed Choice experiments prove that interaction with the first set of detectors is insufficient to collapse the wavefunction/superposition. It's only when the entangled particles arrive at the 2nd set of detectors that determine whether or not which-way information is knowable, does the superposition collapse at the first set, resulting in the correlations. But for the info to be knowable at the second set in order to bring about particle-behaviour, rather than interference patterns, requires a differentiation between what is knowable within the system from what is not, but it's insufficient for the path-info to be knowable to the system itself (ie. the particle that travels), since we detect an interference pattern for that condition. And the interaction with the detector is insufficient, since the behaviour of the first particles of the entangled pairs interacting with the first set of detectors is always found to correlate with the 2nd pair-particle whose behaviour is determined by whether or not path-info is knowable. This demonstrates that a knower is required \*within the system\*, to which the info is either knowable or not knowable. This is what determines the manifest behaviour. Not the interaction with the detector itself, since the first set of detectors fail to collapse the wavefunction out of its suspended state of superposition, independent of time, or external to time, and it's only when the entangled particle subsequently follows its own path that the condition of knowable/not-knowable is satisfied, that the first particle can take on fixed properties to correlate with the conditions of its entangled-pair particle.  So effectively, the image is necessarily and demonstrably created in the moment of observation. The info is then overlaid onto the past, such that the correlation is always correct, even when the conditions for the first entangled particle are no longer congruent with the actual outcome.  If you have 2 paths available for your first entangled-pair particle, but you close off one path after the particle will have travelled through that path, but prior to its interaction with the detector, you will have get a particle-behaviour outcome, even though both paths were open during the actual 'travel-time'. If you leave both paths open until the particle hits the detector, you will always find interference-pattern/waveform behaviour, whereby the particle effectively travels down both paths and interferes with itself as it comes together to hit the detector. The closed-path is irrelevant and yet it affects the manifestation of particle/interference because only the information available within the system in the moment of detection seems to be determining the behaviour of the particle within that system. Not the information existent within the system during what we would describe as the travel-time. Only the info available in the moment of detection.  In fact, scientists at the Australian National University have shown that photons don't actually travel between 2 points (ex. points A and B) at all. (link below)  Rather, when you measure them at B, a path-history is created that conforms to the conditions of the system in the moment of detection, not prior to it. And that path-history/information appears to then be overlaid onto the past. This is a variant of Wheeler's Delayed Choice Experiment, or Quantum Eraser experiments.  Plants use this to make photosynthesis work, in a fascinating way. Photons act as probability waveforms until they reach the chlorophyll cells, where they suddenly behave as particles, allowing photosynthesis to take place. If you're interested, there's amazing research that's been done on this topic in the past 7 or so years.  Unobserved by a conscious observer, a photon exists as a probability distribution spread across the entire universe, meaning any 2 photons that are unobserved, have p-values for/at every point in the universe. This, in and of itself, results in interference.
