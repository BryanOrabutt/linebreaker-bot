Never thought I’d post here but here it goes. My bedroom is not dead (4x a month lately, it used to be 3x a week), we both have HL, I’m 34F, he’s 31M. His mood constantly changes, I stopped initiating because I get rejected, his strange behaviour is making me feel unwanted. Yesterday in the morning he said we need to have sex tonight, because it’s been a while. We went to see his family (we can extend our bubbles now where I live) and I wore red lipstick. He was horny, touchy, grabby and said he can’t wait till we get home. When we finally got home he said, let’s have a shower, he asked me to wear my red lipstick and some sexy lingerie. He jumped in a bath instead, I waited for him to finish and when he got out he asked if I wanted to do some yoga. I said not really, I want to have a shower etc and get ready. I jumped in a cold shower as he used all the hot water, got ready, wore my lingerie and lipstick. Came out of the bathroom to find him doing cardio in the living room. When he finished he was all sweaty and said that he’s now tired and his shoulder hurts. He said “can we watch a movie, I don’t think I can get a hard on”. I got really upset and went to sleep and he played Xbox till 2am. This is not the first time, he’s done it multiple times. Once he started kissing me and we were making out and suddenly he’d stop and said “can we watch Netflix”? Or he’d sext me and ask me to send him nudes whilst at work and then he’d come home and ignore me. This is not normal. I talked to him about it, but he said he can’t help it, he wants to have sex one minute but then his mood changes. I’m very upset. He’s so selfish. I give him head all the time, I even gave him full body massage and edging session and he never returned the favour. He is attracted to me, he flirts, he grabs my ass non stop, gives me compliments, kisses me with passion. This is all very strange. Thanks for reading.
