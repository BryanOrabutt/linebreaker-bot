i used to rule the world chunks would load when i gave the word now every night i go stowaway hide from the mobs i used to slay they once were terrified everytime i looked into their eyes villagers would cheer my way for what a hero i was thats what theyd say one minute we had it all next our world began to fall from all that it had once become they all cried for my help but i stood there numb i gaze off into the boundless skyline noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine turn around pick up my sword and wield the blade that once forced evil mobs to yield and hope one day that this chaos and destruction turn for the better never a bow in hand that was when i ruled the land it was the creepers and the skeletons blew down the doors and boxed us in arrows whizzing by like streaks of light i tried all that i could to stay and fight as the undead roamed the streets families broken at my feet life itself suspended by a thread oh why is if that i wasnt dead i gaze off into the boundless skyline noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine turn around pick up my sword and wield the blade that once forced evil mobs to yield and if this battle should leave me slain i know herobrine will call my name better to take a stand that was when i ruled the land i gaze off into the boundless skyline noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine turn around pick up my sword and wield the blade that once forced evil mobs to yield and if this battle should leave me slain i know herobrine will call my name better to take a stand that was when i ruled the land closet full of secrets and skeletons awakes but nothing's true i used to own a castle now it's boxes that i have to move right here in the darkness there's nothing left for me to do its easier to run away but today today we got to cast the shadows out from sight a final stand a shouting cry all the wrongs now turned to right so fight the past take back the night and call upon the torch tonight to bring out all the ghosts to light because at last we have to go it's time to take back the night to take back the night being chased by monsters to face head on or be consumed reaching out for something grasping on to nothing to lose paybacks left too long unpaid but today today we got to cast the shadows out from sight a final stand a shouting cry all the wrongs now turned to right so fight the past take back the night and call upon the torch tonight to bring out all the ghosts to light because at last we have to go its time to take back the night to take back the night to take back the night so fight the past take back the night take back the night to take back the night and call upon the torch tonight to bring out all the ghosts to light because at last we have to go it's time to take back the night the city it runs cold today sunshine it is shining grey and I wish I could dig straight down black it all away but in the dark theres still a sound and nothing changed dont know if i have ever heard you sing but I hear it hear it hear it hear it hear it dont know if i have ever held your hand but i seek it seek it seek it seek it seek it dont know if i have ever loved but i feel it put the puzzle back together see what im dreaming when i find the pieces don't know if i have ever loved but i feel it put the puzzle back together see what im dreaming when i find the pieces faces echo with no names strangers feel like home but fade dont know if i have ever heard you sing but i hear it hear it hear it hear it hear it dont know if I have ever held your hand but i seek it seek it seek it seek it seek it dont know if i have ever loved but i feel it put the puzzle back together see what im dreaming when i find the pieces don't know if i have ever loved but i feel it put the puzzle back together see what im dreaming when i find the pieces faces echo with no names strangers feel like home but fade lost but marching on like weve always known the trail searching for our ending to the fairy tale sometimes even shooting stars find wishes that miss their marks but when the night gets too dark and the road home seems too far well see the sun come up again we will climb higher than weve been we got a fire that burns within we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted courage to stop a cannonball together we stand thirty feet tall we got a fire that burns within we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted fearless we soar speeding arrows ricochet break free our hearts burn brighter than yesterday and through the battles we wage when our shields fall away the armour cracks and breaks if ever our torches fade well see the sun come up again we will climb higher than we've been we got a fire that burns within we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted courage to stop a cannonball together we stand thirty feet tall we got a fire that burns within we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh we are the dragonhearted standing tall forever united we are the dragonhearted we are the dragonhearted oh oh oh we are the dragonhearted oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh we are the dragonhearted
