So I just had a dream that really scares me because I love my little sister and don’t like seeing her hurt. The dream started off with me sitting on my front porch and I was sitting on the stairs of it and I look to my right and there’s the spider just chillin in its web. So like anyone in their right mind would I moved away (it being a poisonous and deadly spider i didn’t want to mess with it. It made me really uncomfortable. So I sit on the porch a foot or two in front of the front door, and before my sister comes outside I look again to my right and the spider is there I’m not so sure if it was the same one or a different one. And as soon as I look at it my sister comes out and steps in the web and doesn’t notice and I freak out and move her to look and the web is broken and the spider is gone. I didn’t know what to do so I went inside to get my mom (not really the logical thing to do when a child has a spider on them normally you’d check them and wipe them down just in case.) as I was going inside because we have a glass door in front of the wood door it was shut and the wood one open so I can still see and hear her. I get 5 feet into my house and I hear her say “OWWIE!” And start crying really really loud. I panicked and instead of walking to get my mom I screamed for her instead. She came running and in a panic tell my mom she got bit by a deadly spider, my mom of course freaked out and said “Are you serious?!?!” And went out side to check on her then my dream ended it really scared me and I tried looking up the meaning but it only brought up you yourself being bit by the spider not other or family members. Can anyone help me because this is a really big fear of mine I have a really good bond with my 6 year old sister and I try to protect her as much as I can because I’ve been through a lot and don’t want to see her get hurt like I have been my whole life... if anyone could help me out that would be great it’s very urgent to me...
