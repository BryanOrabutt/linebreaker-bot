So me and this girl have been talking for around a month now. The first week we started talking there was a dance at our school so I asked her to it and she told me she didn’t like me like that but she would love to go with me cause I’m funny and cool. So we went to the dance together and had a good time. After that we started talking a lot more, we started texting each other’s numbers instead of snap chatting and we’ve been FaceTiming almost every day. But yesterday she got a little drunk and was on a call with me and she was saying something about a secret and she wouldn’t tell me but I kept asking her and she didn’t wanna tell me because she didn’t wanna say it when she was drunk but she did anyways. The secret was was that she liked me. She told me that she didn’t like me at first but then we started talking more and she gave it more thought and she realized how much of a nice guy I was. I told her the same things and she said she was really insecure about a relationship because she got out of a relationship around 4 months ago. She then got off the call and took a nap. I was talking to her later and she was acting really weird and keep telling me that her friends pushed her to tell me that and she wanted to do it sober. And I told her not to worry about it and she left me on read. I gave it a couple hours and then I called her and tried to talk it out but she was being very hesitant about it and she told me her head hurt from a lot of things and she didn’t tell me what was really bothering her. So I told her I was gonna end the call and just give her some room to breathe and time to relax. I told her to think about it and that I’d talk to her in the morning. This was last night, I texted her this morning and she hasn’t texted me back yet. I’m very worried about everything rn. Idk what is going on with her and why she is acting so different all the sudden. I need some help with what I could do.
