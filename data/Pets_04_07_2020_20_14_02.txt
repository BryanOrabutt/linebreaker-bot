I’m 14 and I’ll be 15 this year. So I’m graduating middle school and going to high school. I never really want much ever but I’ve been wanting a pet. I’ve owned a rabbit but we had to rehome her because we moved. At my dads I owned 3 rats. I was thinking of maybe getting rats again but I like to get different animals to learn about them get as a pet and take care of them. I was thinking of reptiles but I’ve never owned one so I’m not sure. I’d be fine with a reptile of a mammal both are adorable. But I was just wondering a good pet recommendation if I do end up getting one. It doesn’t need to be too quiet but I don’t want something way too loud. So probably no birds maybe if they’re quiet but once again I’ve never owned a bird or any reptiles. I’ve only had cats, dogs, rats, a hamster and a rabbit. I live in a medium sized house and my rooms pretty big. I do have a place to put a tank or cage in my room. Idrc how big it is but if it’s a snake I obviously don’t want one of the really big ones. I’d have enough time to let the animal out for an hour or under maybe longer sometimes. I want something that’s good with handling. Ok with noise since I have two little brothers (10 and 12) they’re not too loud and half the time with my dad but yk. I have thought of rats but I wanted something different. I also really wanted a hedgehog last year but it definitely wouldn’t of been good at my dads. I’m only at my moms now so I’d dedicate all my time home with it so it wouldn’t be someone else half the time. Idk if I’d be able to have it by the end of the school year tho just because idk if I’m getting anything at all yet and if I’m getting something like a hedgehog or something like I haven’t had I wanna put extra thought into it and learn as much as I can. Even if I’m getting an animal I’ve already had I wanna do more research on it. So if you have any websites or YouTubers even books that are good for learning about a pet then you can recommend it. If not it’s ok.
