Hi I’m 30 I’ve suffered from endometriosis probably since my first menstrual cycle, but diagnosed (if you even call it that? Considering I never got scoped ... Dr. just went off my family history - 3 generations of it on my mom’s side...) at 28. My Dr put me on Birth Control and I was on it up until February of this year. I was having really weird mood swings, was terrible at taking it, and am looking to start a family soon so I decided I’d stop taking it. I did mention this to the Physician Assistant at my last check up in February as well. She said that I would be fine but if I started to experience severe pain again that I should consider talking through my options. Pain again? I had it the whole time I was on the pill, milder, yes, but pain alas. Which tbh is also one of the reasons I was like, “why am I even on bc? I would love to start a family in the near future, I’m terrible at taking it, it messes with my emotions, and I still get cramps.” I’ve lived a good 15+ years with terrible cramps so doing my best to manage them has become a monthly routine. What has not become a routine is randomly getting what feels like a UTI for a day.... in this case... two days. I’ve been up all night (same as a couple of nights ago) with the urge to pee, painful urination, and full bladder pain. This is not the first time it’s happened, though it’s sparingly. I honestly believe it’s not a UTI because I take good care of my lady bits before and after sex, after going to the bathroom, hygiene,etc. it’s not to say it isn’t, but with how it occurs it just doesn’t feel like grounds for a UTI. Anyway. Me and my fiancé have been knocking boots a lot the past couple days, we can’t keep our hands off each other and we used a toy, that he cleaned before using, but it is glass... and it was the evening after we used it that I started feeling this way. Then, because I thought nothing of it and was feeling better the next day — when I say better I mean 100% better like I never had any pain while peeing 24 hours earlier— we had sex in the afternoon... using the same toy. No pain during sex, no pain afterwards... I used the restroom directly after to flush anything out... and here I am, I’ve been up since 2 am with that same UTI pain. I’ve been googling all night thinking that maybe it has something to do with the glass toy? Maybe it cut me or has a coating on it that I’m allergic to (also have the worlds most sensitive skin) and then I came across IC and how people with endometriosis experience this. But I didn’t find anything on sex being a trigger for IC... are there other triggers? I am just about to ovulate (ovulation calendar says I’ll be ovulating Tuesday), could that be it? It doesn’t happen every time I ovulate and tbh I can’t remember the last time it happened and it’s never happened longer than 24 hours. I’ve chalked it up to endo before, this time because of the use of the toy on both occasions I started to think that could be it but am I crazy to think this is IC? If you feel that this should be posted elsewhere please let me know, I’m just honestly trying to figure it out. Sorry for the long post, but it’s helped me distract myself from the pain for awhile 🙄🙃
