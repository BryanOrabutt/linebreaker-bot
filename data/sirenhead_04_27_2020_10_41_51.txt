It was 7:00 in the afternoon and starting to get dark. I had been heading back home from hunting trip when suddenly, my car had broken down! “What the hell?” I mumbled to myself. When I got out of the car, I realized that I was by a Hiking Trail. “I need to find a place to crash for the night.” I thought maybe there would be a renting cabin or something to stay the night at, at least until I fix my car. When I stared going to the trail, i saw some shreds of shirts on the path, and smelled the air. “What’s they smell >~<“ I asked my self. I Ignored the smell and continued walking. While I got deeper down the path, the smell got even worse. To the point where I felt sick! I then saw large scratch marks on the trail and followed them. The search marks led off the trail, and I stupidly followed it. Then, I saw the source of the smell. ITS WAS A DEAD HUMAN BODY! “Oh my god..😰.” I said quietly. I needed to get back to the car as fast as possible but, I lost the trail. I heard a loud siren off in the distance and I got paranoid and was shaking. I started running as fast as I can, while I was panting, and zig zagging through the woods and full speed. I tripped on a log when I turned around and realized, a huge creature was staring at me! The creature was about 40-50ft tall with long, lean arms like his legs. He had 2 sirens for his head and could mimic radio systems and friends of his prey.  I was frozen in fear as he began playing a loud purge siren noise as he was moving toward me. I then got up and was running away, screaming as loud as I could. I was more happy then ever when I found the trail/path back to the car! The creatures followed me down the path until I got to my truck. I jumped in the car breathing heavily, and started it. I could hear the creatures loud footprints and his fingers scrape the car. I took off as fast as I could after that. The Creature was to slow to catch up with the car, and let me go. I couldn’t believe what I just saw. It was hard to breathe when I was running so fast, I’m just glad I’m safe now. But I will never forget, The Siren Head...
