A lot of men have a lot of self worth issues, they feel as though their self worth dictates on whether or not they have had sex with beautiful women or not. Men have sex with their girlfriends,wives, lovers whatever you want to call it and then seek validation and approval from their peers or other men or whoever to see if they are good enough or not. Hey look I had sex with all these women, am I good enough now? I want to show the whole world how awesome I am so I am going to create a video and show the world (through pornography) that I’m amazing for having sex with all these women. Do you approve of me now? I think there is a deep seated need to find the approval of the father. What have you actually accomplished by having sex with these women? How do you feel afterwards? I’m not saying it’s wrong to have sex with beautiful women, I think experiencing beauty is a beautiful thing but depending on how you relate to the experience you may not accomplish what you wanted. You need to explore this for yourself. Do you feel a strong connection and love for the woman? Did you break her heart? Did you diminish her self worth and make her feel ashamed of herself? Maybe you created a beautiful experience with the woman and want to marry her. The point I am alluding to is where does a mans self worth come from? Is it predicted out of an outcome. If I have sex with a woman I will feel good, if I don’t then I will feel bad. Is your life outcomes based? If this is the case then you may experience the feeling of rejection, it was never meant to be taken personally. She just doesn’t feel like sleeping with you and that’s fine, you have to respect her wishes if that’s the case. If she trusts you then she will follow you and surrender herself fully to you so you can experience more of her. She has to trust you and feel safe in order for this to happen. She doesn’t want to fall. Don’t drop her. You are going to get hurt as well in the process.
