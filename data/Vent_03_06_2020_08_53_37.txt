Hello everyone i finally decided to create my reddit account after browsing reddit for 3 years forgive my punctuation and grammar skills for they are terrible.. I am a male(28) uhm idk how to put this but i always had this feeling of a beast inside of me with this constant hunger of my sexual urges and sometimes when it doesnt get what it wants there is this lingering empty feeling inside me and it pulls me down idk how else to say it but sigh this is going to make me sound crazy lol, its a every day thing for me after having sex it give it no more than 30 minutes to an hour before i am ready to go and its very hungry lol !. the thing is the reason i am worried about this its because of what turns me on it comes off very fucked up its like pure domination which is fine to me but it can go a bit too far and my whole demeanor changes as what ive been told and after recording myself i realize i look possessed LOL!! . but it is very true and very eye opening experience , i had an incident once with this girl i met on tinder i dont know what triggered it but it felt like it took over again but i started choking her at first it was just a normal choking sexual thing but it started to be more agressive and i started saying weird things she said at first it was okay but the look in my eyes while i was choking her startd to scare her and she felt like i was taking it too far she said it looks like i was in a trance. me and her hang out but i kinda dont want to get into a situation where i could hurt someone sigh im retarded also if anyone could point me to the right direction on to where i could seek some help on reddit i tried going to a therapist for  this but idk it doesnt really help me out once again very sorry for my poor grammar skills this is extremely embarrassing thank god nobody knows me online
