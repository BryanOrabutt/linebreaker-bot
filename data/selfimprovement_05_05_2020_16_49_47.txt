Growing up I was really liked by people,I was outspoken,fun and funny but I felt the change started when I got publicly humiliated in high School,I guess I just kinda kept to myself, I couldn't really make much friends cause of said humiliation,I did manage to make a group of friends in my final year but I had to transfer and that was it.i got into uni and I didn't have friends,I got all the info about school work from the group and didn't have to talk to anyone,by second semester a girl approached me and we became kind of friends,some months passed I met some other guys from different places in school and we hang out sometimes but I don't think I consider them friends,we could talk about deep stuff  even my family but sometimes I make excuses when they want to meet up or ignore their calls or texts or even answer the phone and later put in on airplane mode like it was a network problem,I made excuses to not video call mostly because I'm shy in general,I'm a bad person.i see the way people have friendships and relationships but I can't cause I push people away, I'm worse with relationships my last relationship lasted for 2 years and I didn't even love the guy,I've never felt genuine love for anyone,I just care about them.i've only felt jealous because the only girlfriend I had began talking to my roommate and hanging out with her more.i recently began dating again and the same stuff keeps happening,I have little or no interest in talking to him.it's like I push people away and then complain about not having friends,I want to be alone but sometimes I see or read stuff and I don't wanna be alone, sometimes I try to picture my future and I'm alone in it,as much as I have an I don't care attitude,I don't want to die alone,it's like everyone is leaving me behind and achieving things but I'm stuck here,I feel like a total loser.i give up easily when things don't go my way,I've had to drop hobbies,I'm 21 now and I'm scared I'm growing up and almost finishing college and my life is gonna be like how it was at the start of it...I really don't want to die alone,I keep feeling like I will if I don't change but how can I change who i've been my whole life?
