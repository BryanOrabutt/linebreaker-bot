I was playing fortnite since season 2, and was playing it everyday many hours a day for over a year, since season 3 and have completed all the battlepasses up to season 10. This is the first season that I haven't touched since probably 10 days after launch and haven't looked back, I truly loved fortnite and invested a lot of time and money because it was a game I truly enjoyed and it felt worth spending the money, now it feels like all the passion and creativity for the game is gone from content creators, dev's, and players alike,  it feels like the same rinse and repeat cycle of looting and harvesting for 10-15 minutes to either get 1 shot in the head with a sniper from over 200 meters or just kind of avoid interactions except maybe a few ai and a fight or two. The new map feels lack luster and too big with no mobility items and can feel unfair when you are literally running across the whole map just to position to the point where I'd rather quit out then run across the map to get blown up or sniped with no loot because I was running all game. The gameplay no longer feels rewarding to win battles or even games considering the effort you need to put in just to compete with all the sweaty players that are able to play 8 hours a day, I got my one victory this season and pretty much called it quits, even the battlepass which would motivate me to play at least till at end of the season to grind out tiers I don't care about and it will be the first battle pass since I've paid for and I will not complete since my first battlepass in season 3, simply because I dont feel like  not enjoying myself for a (in my opinion) few mediocre cosmetics that would be more taxing in time than it's worth, I really want to be able to enjoy the game again but I'm sad to say I just can't anymore, this isn't a "FoRtNitE iS DyInG" post because we all know it's not true but simply a question, is this game enjoyable anymore? How so and what have you guys been doing to have fun because even running a squad with good friends we all agree we think it might be time to move on and just find a new game to sink time into, at this point it's been about November/December when I last actually sat down and played more than one match before quitting and I just dont have that urge to hop on after a long day and just hit squads and get that Vicroy with the boys.
