Hey guys, so a bit of Back story I am currently 16 years old and in year 10 this all started in around halfway through year 7 where I met a girl, let's call her linda instantly when I had seen her I knew she was someone who I wanted to be with I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like the popular stereotype girl I like goofy,cute sweet and someone who can be themselves around me a girl who lights up when they see me, anyway fast forward a couple weeks of getting to know her she asks me out and I obviously accept I liked this girl, turns out she was transgender and secretly wanted to transition to a boy now I was straight all my life but my love for this person now who I refer to as a boy we can call him Charlie was so deep that I was okay with it I supported him through it as best I could that first year was the happiest of my life then halfway through the second year he would hit me constantly and these hits hurt, it was his only way of trying to get my attention he never got much from his parents so he didint know how aswell as this he didint want to fully let me In because of his past (alot of people have been horrible to him) and this continued for quite some time then he would say verbal put downs to me which honestly I deflected for the first 8 months but after that it just got to me way to much I couldn't take it from someone who I loved so dearly so I told him and he stopped, he apologized he stopped hitting he stopped always putting me down around 2 months later his mum got lung cancer and was going through intense care during this time he was extremely sad so id do whatever  I could to cheer him up buy him his favourite chocolate almost every week or some nutella doughnuts from the bakery and give him all my love I could luckily his mum came out okay and beat cancer (great achievement) now I'm gonna fast forward a little bit id say to when we were approaching our third year of dating he told me he wanted to do a poly relationship (where you date multiple people at once) at first I was absolutely against it but once again I loved him so dearly so I tried to make him happy but it just didint work and I couldn't handle it we always clashed for the years we dated and to be honest as much as this hurts me to say I don't think we should of ever dated we just weren't compatible so nearly at 3 years we decided to mutually break up we still stay friends and talk often but it's hurt the both of us quite a bit me way more I loved him more than anything for the first week or two I cried myself to sleep I still love him even 2 months later after breaking up, I have a new girlfriend now who I love dearly and she supports me with this amazingly and she is truly an angel but I have this numb feeling where just feel empty and it's because Charlie was a part of me a big one and it was ripped off those three years despite everything were the happiest of my life I'm not going to go into what we did sexually that will stay lock and and key but none of that even matters, I still miss him I still think of him and I can't stand it and it's really broken me im healing but it's painfully slow this was really just a place to vent for me so if you made it this far I thank you and I think I'll always love charlie no matter what that's what hurts the most.
