aztez are too hard  to get and too easy to lose    the assasination event just sucks  if  you lose  you lose 2 aztez which is just so frustrating when the time runs out because you cant kill the  spear boss  (it deals a  lot of damage and its also hard to deal damage to  it since you cant grab it)   also talking about time running out why does the aztez die again?  its  so frustrating when there is only like one enemy left and the time runs out so the aztez  just dies     and you know what? i love a challenge but the thing is   when you lose all your aztez  the campaign just ends...  and there is no quicksave function   so  you lose everything  which is just too discouraging if you ask me   the campaign has a potential  to be really fun but its just way too punishing  and rng based   these are some thoughts  i had about what could be done about it               character progression: there could be  a rpg like system in which  you equip gear  for stats  or level up to make aztez stronger and get new abilities   making  you stronger in combat as you progress       difficulty: a difficulty system could be implemented   so we can choose our own  instead of the default game difficulty        easy:   enemies deal 0.50x damage    aztez deal 2x damage      %40 more blood           bosses are grabbable         normal: (the normal game)          hardcore:  enemies deal 2x damage  aztez deal  0.80x damage    %20 less blood                    quicksave function:  doesnt really requires a explanation does it?             anyways sorry about my b\*tching   just some thoughts  i had about the campaign :)
