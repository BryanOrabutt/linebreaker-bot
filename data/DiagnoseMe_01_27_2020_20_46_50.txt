 Hi so my story is kind of long I just need some opinions on some  symptoms I had since around 2 years ago, and people here have a lot of  knowledge about MS, I am a 21 year old Male. So it started when I was  19. I started feeling this tingling on my feet so I started searching  for possible causes on the internet (probably bad idea) so I thought I  had MS because the first symptom is usually tingling. Ok so I went to a  neurologist who ordered a brain MRI and a EEG. The doctor was pretty  good and the first thing he suspected was actually MS but both of my  test came back fine, no scars on my brain and normal EEG. So I continued  my life thinking it was just anxiety or stress. Months later I started  having some aches on my hands so I went to another doctor who ordered a  hand MRI, XRAY, some blood tests and a EMG of my hand and basically  found nothing wrong. I kind of ignored the tingling on my feet at the  time so I don't remember having it so often. So went to two doctors and  all the tests came fine. After all the tests I just went on with my  life. The next year I started having twitching on my legs, arms and  hands, the twitching was kind of random but it scared me to death  because it thought I had ALS. I never checked this with a doctor because  twitching in ALS comes with weakness and I never had this symptom. So  now I have no idea what's wrong with me because I have tingling feet,  its probably a bit worse than before, some occasional twitching and I am  having some tingling on my face that appeared around 2 months ago, I  have a terrible posture so that's probably the cause of the tingling on  my face but I still don't have no idea on the cause of the other  symptoms. So I just wanted to share my story and read what you guys  think of my symptoms. Could it be MS or something else?
