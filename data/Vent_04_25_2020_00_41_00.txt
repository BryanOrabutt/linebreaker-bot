I have to to through another fucking year of having to calm my friend down whenever her toxic friend starts being a dick again. I helped her during their friendship and relationship and I was there for her after she finally said she had enough with his toxic behavior and now they're becoming friends again because she keeps venting to him. I feel useless. Why does she need me when she has the school shooter looking person who goes to shooting ranges, dated her and then broke up with her on her best friend's birthday, had a crush on her best friend and then acted like her best friend owed her something, insulted her best friend, then tried to guilt trip him. Oh let's not forget how he pointed out her best friend's self harm scars when her bestfriend was wearing jeans with holes in them and he said she was seeking for attention even though her scars were a year old. Let's not forget how when they were dating, she was crying and he got mad at her for not telling at him and he made her seem like she was the bad person. Let's not forget HE STARTED EVERY SINGLE FUCKING ARGUMENT AND THEN BLAMED HER. LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT HOW HE TOLD HER HE WAS GONNA KILL HIMSELF AFTER SHE TRIED TO STOP BEING FRIENDS BECAUSE HE HAD GONE TOO FAR. LET'S NOTF ORGET ABOUT HOW THAT HAUNTED HER FOR TWO FUCKIGN WEELS AND EVERY NIGHT SHE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA DO IT AND I STAYED UP HOURS FOR HER. I dont want to see her hurt again. She's going to become friends with him again and she's going to get hurt and I dont know how I'm supposed to emotionally be there for her. I've told her everything before multiple times when she needed support before and if she didnt listen to that then she wont listen to me now. I'm going to relapse and cut I can't handle this I dont want her hurt I dont want her hurt. I wished he did kill himself when he said he would. He's not changing how fucking stupid can she be he's not going to change anytime soon he's still a narcissistic asshole.
