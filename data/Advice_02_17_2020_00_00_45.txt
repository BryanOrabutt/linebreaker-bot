I never thought I’d be posting here, but here we go. I’m in need of some second thoughts. I am a female, and have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now. We live together, and anyone who saw us would think we have the perfect relationship. He’s always been loving and caring, we are always doing stuff together, and we never really had any serious arguments before. Sounds perfect right? HA!!! I then find out one night after snooping through his phone (I know, bad, but my gut was telling me something was up) that throughout our entire relationship he had downloaded a bunch of dating/hookup apps. Not only that, but he literally through hundreds of dollars at these sites. I also found a bunch of hidden messages of him sexting girls and talking about meeting up. I confronted him about it all, and he said that he would just sext girls to jerk off, but never actually met up with them. I hope he’s telling the truth about that part. What I’m most frustrated about is how guiltless he was. He was able to lie our entire relationship, and have sexual conversations with hundreds of girls while we have this amazing relationship. And I could understand if I was a horrible girlfriend and super repulsive, but I’m not. I don’t want to break up, but I’m so angry that the person who I thought was perfect was able to lie straight to my face, and be consistently cheating on me like it was no big deal. Last part. There were multiples sites I found, but I only had told him that I had knowledge of one of them to see if he would come clean about everything. And of course he said that he would only do it on one site, which was a LIE! And even in the moment of confrontation instead of being honest and telling me the truth he still chooses to LIE. So I’m confused, I’m hurt, and I don’t know what to think or do. I know I wrote a lot, and I hope it made sense because there’s more to it. Anyways, I would love if anyone has any advice/thoughts on my unfortunate situation. Happy Sunday ya’ll.
