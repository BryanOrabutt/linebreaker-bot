You probably know this is from me, I’ve already said too much to give it away. I’m torn between leaving you more clues and lying to hide from you. Either way, I don’t think you’d reach out. And I’m not sure what’s a bigger internal conflict, the desire to reach out myself and the desire to let life go on as planned. It’s been a while since I’ve spoken to you, and I don’t really remember if it was you or me that brought us to an end. I just know there never really was an us. I guess it’s wishful thinking, to say I broke your heart. I remember you drunk on my patio, chain smoking and promising me you loved me, that it wasn’t something you were just saying, that you meant it. And I swore in that moment your eyes were sincere. But I knew you too well. I hope you go into politics, one day, so I can vote for you. I always saw you as this charming cult-figure of my past. And I know you could seduce an entire room with that stupid fucking grin. I kept a journal from those days, pretty embarrassing, looking back. I don’t know if I was lying to myself in my journal, but I said I held back from admitting the truth to you. The way I remember it, I spilled my fucking guts and you left me on read. Days before you’d sworn we were meant to be together, which I never even asked for, by the way. I was happy to be your best friend! But then you came to see me and you changed everything! And I still don’t know why... why did you do that? It’s okay if you didn’t want to be my friend anymore, it’s cool that we don’t talk. I seriously just want to know why you had to fuck with my head? You’re a good person, I saw it, and I doubt you even know or care what you did, but it fucked me up. And I still fucking forgive you. So, I guess what I’m saying is, please, if you’re reading this, just know it hurt, but I can’t handle being hurt by you again. So please don’t reach out, I’m finally healing, I think.
