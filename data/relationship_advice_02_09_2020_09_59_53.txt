i've been dating this girl for about 2 months and basically she's been distant, I believe it's due to the fact that this time around 4-5 years ago, her father passed away. And I think she's just dealing with a lot. I've checked in on her a couple times, and I'm just worried about her because she hasn't been reaching out to me and when I did hit her up (I asked if everything is alright, or if everything is okay between us), she said "I've had better days/weeks...". My anxiety thinks that I fucked things up with maybe being too needy (something I did about 2 weeks ago), but the realistic side knows this may just be because of her own personal problems. Regardless..... the right move would be to wait for her to reach out to me, right? I dont want to be the one constantly reaching out. I told her that I'm here if she ever wants to talk and she said thank you for always checking in (that's just the gist of our last conversation). I really like her, and from her actions I know she's into me, but she's never verbally said it or expressed it. I dont want to be an asshole (because for fucks sake her father passed away and my heart breaks for her) but it's been about 4 days since we last spoke and I'm fucking worried about what's going on.... and again, it's been me always reaching out these past 1-2 weeks. Don't get me wrong, she does reply and is sweet, but she doesnt keep the conversation going, nor does she open up about how she's feeling about the matter and I wish she would... Should I give her some time and later this month check in on her again (or maybe even talk about her about being so closed off towards me?) Or should I just move on, and find someone who is emotionally ready for something real and can offer me consistency/communication no matter what's going on? I guess at the core of this all - I wish she would talk to me about what's going on, rather than pushing me away. Even if she is uninterested in us dating anymore. (btw I'm 22F, we're both women)
