started running a BG in 5e dnd game, and j wanted to say it’s the funnest thing I have done in ages. Admittedly I’m changing quite a lot of the encounters to make them more exciting or at least more of what my players want because BG can be a bit Grindy which doesn’t really make a fun dnd game, but the overall story is a really one. The players are all bhaalspawn (so all have visions etc and also all make different decisions about what to do in them) but the best thing is how inventive they have been, so for the bandit camp I made tazok a hill giant to make him a bit more challenging, and they decided to find the camp and instead of conventionally fight they went to a store and bought all the oil they could find in it and any store near it and then they built about 15 Molotov cocktails and then spent three days scouting the countryside (they have a Druid and ranger) for poisonous mushrooms and other poisonous ingredients, put them in a potion and then, found a dead kobold marinade it in the liquid and managed to sneak the kobold into the camp and trick a guard (3 Nat 20s in a row!) as tazok’s next meal which he ate and subsequently rolled a nat 1 constitution save on and died, they then chucked all of the Molotov cocktails and started a forest fire, and then they ran away into the forest never to be seen again. Boss fight avoided and I had to think of some new story hooks to give them. They then decided to go the coast and so I made daevaron  a vampire pirate (I basically copied Luthor Harkon from TWW2) who had a secret mining colony on a far of island and took slaves there (instead of cloak wood) so they pretended to be slaves and have been taken to the port for the ship to the island, the coolest moment I’ve had yet in a game was when his ghostly ship arrived while over voice call the seas shanty of the vampire coast was playing, first time I’ve seen my players properly awestruck, I’m so hyped to run the next session. That’s one thing I have realised as this is my first campaign, I design a load of stuff around the music for it, because I did a whole this about the players entering the temple of a servant of bhaal just after mulahey (to try and give them a bit more of an obvious idea of their heritage) and it was based on the seven sins, but I think the music made it, I ended up using children of the omnissiah, made it soooooo much better. Sorry for the self indulgent post j wanted to talk about this :)
