having a mother who is truly the most unloving person to you is the most exhausting thing. having to experience mental pain at a young age is the most tiring thing. having a parent who supports you materialistically but no where mentally is the most tiring thing. having a parent who drains your mental energy is the most tiring thing. having to wish for another parent is the most tiring thing. i personally wish i had someone who i could call my "Mother" i wish i had someone who doesn't drain my mental energy. i wish i had the love of a mother at **all times**. i wish i had a mother as a best friend. it is **exhausting** being a daughter. it is **exhausting** sacrificing my mental wellness for her. it is **exhausting** having to hear her say "i did this for you" or "i bought you everything" i'm beyond fucking tired and exhausted of having a mother who petrifies me every day of my life. i'm tired of having a mother using every insecurity you have in an argument. of having a family who belittles you in everything you do. of having a father who became your first bully. sacrificing your mental health your entire life because of someone who is supposed to be your best fucking friend, but ends up being the reason you cry going to bed. it is exhausting being compared to cousins you're whole life because they do everything better. it is exhausting having to go every mother's day or father's day knowing your parents didn't deserve anything. imagine making your child feel so **abandoned** from you and having no knowledge why. imagine being so stubborn, hurtful, and damaging from your child they run into arms of another human being they'd love to call a mother. i **hate** being my parent's daughter. especially my **mother**. i'm sixteen. but no child should ever experience something like this. every child should have a mother who loves them unconditionally. it breaks my heart knowing i look at other people's mothers as my own. it saddens me how much grief i've went through.  it saddens me how much years i've wasted my life on. how much of me i had to sacrifice for her. all because of something damaging. i feel beyond damaged.
