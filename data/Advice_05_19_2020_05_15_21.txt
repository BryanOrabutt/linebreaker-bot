So, there was a girl I met in hs and our relationship grew to be more than I expected.  We were always together but nothing really happened mainly bc I was stupid and can see now that I was too shy and should have taken her out when I had the chance.  Jump to my senior year we still talked and said hi to one another it was prom season and I had decided to go with a group of friends so we could go out afterwards so I again missed my chance to ask her to go with me.  She came to my graduation and we talked a lot over that summer leading into my freshman year of college.  I finally told her after months of talking how I felt about her and was determined not to miss this opportunity.  I got a call back she was crying and told me she liked someone else.  I decided it was time to move on and I did although I never met anyone in college.  Now to current time, I was pretty lonely during quarantine and remembered how happy I was when I was with her so I decided to text her expecting to be blocked.  To my surprise she responded and we have been talking on and off for about two weeks.  My problem is that my feelings I had for her never left and now I feel them resurfacing.  We text for awhile in spurts and have a good convo, but she waits like a day or two to respond.  Mainly I have been reaching back out bc I want to talk to her.  I like her that’s for sure, but idk what she wants when we talk it’s great but the waiting days with no response has me wondering.  Is she reserved about getting to deep in and it ending bad?  I’m apprehensive too bc I do not want to be broken hearted again.  I have a plan to see if this gets better and by June if it does not I need to stop and move on fully if it does then I’ll tell her how I feel.  Mainly I’m confused by her and by my own self.  What to do???
