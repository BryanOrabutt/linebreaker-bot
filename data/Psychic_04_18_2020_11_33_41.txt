Keep in mind time is fluid with this read so either this has already happened for some of you, currently happening or on the way. For the majority I'm speaking for you've really been in an energy of not allowing any toxins into your life, you're focused on growth within yourself, some of you I'm getting you may be reconnecting or getting in tune with spirituality, I'm feeling feminine energy so some of you could quite possibly be connecting with a woman or a male with feminine energy. But I'm definately seeing you're in an energy of wanting to explore new passions,  desires, and even connections whether it's working more on your art, music, or even just yourself I really see you sticking to the craft that makes you feel whole in these chaotic times, probably because some of you finally have the time to explore these passions where as before maybe work had gotten in the way. I dont swe you holding back these passions I see them being worked towards, for some of you, you may have felt what you were trying to put your energy towards you weren't skilled enough, or you secretive/afraid of the criticism of others. But I do see some of you taking your time and practicing bringing the perfectionist out of yourself, where as the rest of you still may try finding excuses for why you're not chasing what you're after. This is a time to enjoy the fruitfulness of your abilities,  explore what you've never realized about yourself  listen to different music, connect with other redditors, learn new languages,  expand yourself and dont let anyone try to tell you you're no good because regardless at the end of the day readers, you're the only person that can be happy with yourself, we all get one life, so why not do the most to enjoy ours to the fullest, a lot of people come to me and ask Snoop, I'm in a stuck energy how do I get out of this? I've been in a cycle for so long, my life is like groundhog day. For those people I advise, life isnt all about material things, life isnt all about love, yes those things can be important depending on your lifestyle, but expanding your capabilities and gaining motivation to explore in your life is always going to be the way you unlock the key to that mental prison of being stuck, and see the wonderful world of opportunities your mind can journey onâ›¼ Peace Love and Blessings, I'm about to go meditation ðŸ˜… ~Uncle Snoopâ›¼
