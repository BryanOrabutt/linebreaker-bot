 Not sure if this fits but hear we go also Redditor if you are reading this I watch your videos and I love your channelSo let me give you some back story me and this kid had been a friend since year six however soon I started to realise that he was asking for skins on fortnight time and time again when I gave him he would be happy however if I refused he would become annoyed and angry with me I should’ve realised it was a toxic and one-sided relationship but I didn’t how I wish I had this all started the other day when the Harley Quinn skin came out naturally he asked me for it but I said no he got triggered left the party and hung up on me I was a little hurt but I didn’t really mind I was used to his behaviour by now The next day my best friend wasn’t in I wondered why and went up to entitled friend to ask but he just ignored me then later he came up to me and started mouthing off about my best friend behind her back when she wasn’t in school he said that he don’t wanna be her friend anymore I said that was up to him but I didn’t wanna get involved as I still liked her as a friend he got huffy and walked off The next day I come in and my best friend is in I’ve got to talk to her but she ignores me my other friend was in a project with her and she still didn’t talk to him either I ask my non-entitled friend but not my best friend what was happening he said that he didn’t know but I had a sneaking suspicion that EF was pulling some strings I had no proof so O f didn’t believe me then out of the blue e f pulls me aside and “I told bf about our conversation yesterday” “what convo Bro” “the convo about bf and you not wanting to be friends with her any mor” I’m dumbstruck because last time I checked he was the one saying that not me I walk off and continue my day at home I text  bf and tell her that I do want to be friends and that EF was lying she text me back with I don’t trust you I said please be friends again she says no I said please she says fine sure I said thank you she says no problem I walk in the next day and try to talk to her still no response from her I asker why she is ignoring me and she finally says “I changed my mind” I am in complete turmoil I don’t know what to think or what to do i’m just sad angry and confused if there is one good thing that’s come from this is that me and my other friend have become really cloes i’m just tired of this crap man
