ive been wanting to tell u that yes we met in a way where maybe i wasnt a big deal to u but u made such a significant impression on me that when u left, it took me a whole year and a half to stop thinking about u. i have gone on dates, met with other guys, kissed them, been intimate with some but nothing comes close to how i felt about u. maybe u and i are too incompatible and u dont know what u want, but u have been the “guy” in my life so far. im trying my best to get over u and i hope i succeed one day but i surely dont regret meeting u and feeling the way i do. nobody else has made me feel so intensely, maybe u think im crazy because im so forthcoming with u but i do want u really bad and i’ll take what i can get. there really isnt much that distinct about u that makes girls fawn because i sure have met guys that are better prospects but i do like u for my own reasons. i have never met somebody who makes my body light up the way u do, u make me want to keep kissing u. i dont want to have sex with anybody else other than you; when u repeatedly told me how badly u wanted me, i died inside. i just want to be yours. i need u so badly it actually hurts me and i cant feel asleep so im writing this letter with a bit of tears in my eyes. i dont know why uve come back in my life but it surely is ripping me apart that despite all the changes uve gone through, i still love u as much if not more. please either just come to me and be mine or leave for once and let me move on. which i know wont happen unless i fall in love with somebody else. i just miss u so much. i am so pathetic. i know i can do better. i know i can go out right now and find a boyfriend that will love me. but everything in life has been halted because of u. i cant even bear to look at another guy because ive been so in love with u.
