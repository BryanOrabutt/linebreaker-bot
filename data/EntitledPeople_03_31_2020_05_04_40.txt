So this was before this COVID-19. My dog is a Golden retriever and is the sweetest thing ever.                                       so I was coming from the store and I see my drunk ass neighbor and some hoes ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® out in my back yard.                     when I looked in his hand it was a charger and not the floppy one it was a braded cord and he was hitting her so just jumped out of my car half stopped and ran.                                    Me: WTF do you think you're doing                                                  D: I'm teaching her some fucking manners.                                       Me: first off you are fucking commiting a crime here and if she bit one of you fucking hoes they can go and screw them self's. At this point I'm pissed so to make matters worse he hit her again.                                                                                     Me: do that one more fucking time I dare you.                               Hoe 1: do something about you dog she bit my leg.                     Me:I hope she would of bit him and not let go.                      This HOE HIT HER AGAIN.                                                                                           I called out my pit bull.                                                                         Me: That's it (walking to the door) *opens door* LUMINE.            Me:You better run.                                                                                       D:(sees lumine run to the door) RUN.                                              I havent have to call LUMINE out again and she wouldn't have done anything any ways shes just one big love bug any was I hope you're as pissed as I am.
