To start with I’m sorry for poor formatting I’m on my phone, second this is my first Reddit post ever and it’s with a throwaway go figure, okay so I’ve been in a long distance relationship with a girl for 9 months now I live in one continent, she lives in another and we’ve never met but we FaceTime every day and we text all the time, I love her and she says she loves me, I’m 16 and she’s 15. Up until 2 months ago everything was great, sure we would fight once every so often but we always made up straight away, then about 2 months ago everything started going downhill, she has to stay off my insta page because she gets upset at “how pretty” my friends are, (90% of my friends are girls because guys bullied me all throughout high school) oh and related to this I can’t talk about anything to do with any girls that aren’t my mum or sister because she will get upset or jealous. She constantly wants to be on FaceTime and if we aren’t she hates it if I take more than 10 minutes to respond, because my memory is terrible I’ve had to start keeping a list of things she’s told me she wants me to do, such as good morning paragraphs, not going on pause on FaceTime and the already mentioned not talking about any female friends, also it feels like I can’t tell her anything because whenever I’m unhappy about something she gets unhappy too, and if it’s something she did she’ll flip it around onto me, I’ve had to change so many things just to keep her happy and I’m not sure what to do, like as much as I complain and even though we are arguing every other night I still love her and I want this to work and I know we would both be really hurt if we broke up but I’m starting to get worried that this relationship isn’t going to end well, the constant fighting is so tiring, also because of the time difference between us is 6 hours we always end up calling at like midnight for me until like 3 am and the fighting always happens between 2 and 3 which means I end up staying up till 4-5 to make sure she’s happy and everything’s okay, I think I’ve said everything it I remember anything else I’ll add it somewhere, any advice is helpful and I’m sorry about how messy that was it’s currently 1am and I’ve had a busy day. Thank you in advance.
