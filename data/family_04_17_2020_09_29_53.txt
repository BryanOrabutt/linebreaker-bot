So basically my dad got a back injury when I was in 3rd grade and at that time I didn’t really care as I didn’t really hang out with him and didn’t realise how it would impact my life. So now 6 years later he never makes any effort to hangout with me or even talk to me. whenever I talk to him he always makes me feel like he never wanted me, it upsets me so much because he’s turned into a fat asshole who always uses others especially me for his benefit (not sexually what so ever if you’re thinking that) with things like him making me get him a beer and me making food for him. He always yells/screams at me and it’s really scary as I usually make a tiny mistake and instead of him telling how i could of fixed it he emotionally abuses me. I know I’m meant to be a big strong tuff guy who doesn’t show his emotions but it’s getting to the point where I can’t hide them anymore. It upsets me seeing all my mates dads being really cool and like whenever I go over to there houses I see there dads loving them even know my mates don’t notice that I would literally do anything for my dad to show the tiniest bit of love to me. I try my hardest I’ve joined a one of the military cadet groups trying to get him to encourage me but he never does. I know I’m only 14 but It’s starting to make me suicidal and I know those thoughts are really bad but I’m trying to deal with them. My parents never listen to me and always hit me to get back at me they also use the “I pay for all of this so how about you do something” implying for me to get a job (legally I can’t work at my current age). I really just want someone to show me some love as no one ver gives me a hug or asks how I am. I know this is more of a ramble I just want to know if anyone else my age experiences this I know I have all these cool things like an Xbox and a phone but I just want to know if anyone else’s dads do this to them. Sorry but I’m just an emotional train wreck right now.
