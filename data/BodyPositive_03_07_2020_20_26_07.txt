So currently I sit at 5’2” and 142lbs. Which seems to me like a healthy weight for my height. But what I came from looks a lot different. I used to use drugs, I used to have an eating disorder, and I have a mother who was a model and would actually encourage my eating disorder etc so when I first got clean and “came to,” I only weighed about 85lbs. I got compliments at this weight about how thin I was and how “fit” I seemed. Wow. I was SO sick, and so stressed and so unhappy with my body. I’ve always been on the petite side tho, it’s just in my genes. So sitting clean at 100lbs was about average for me. I’d never had to work out for it, never had to watch what I ate, diet was a foreign idea to me. But then I got attacked. I got beat within inches of my life with an electric guitar. And I only weighed about 95lbs at the time, and with no muscle mass I wasn’t strong enough to fight back. I tried! But the strength to overpower him just wasn’t there. So once I got thru that, I started lifting weights. I found it hard to gain muscle mass with the nearly anorexic diet I was working with tho, so I started adding FOOD. No diet in particular, just food. Nothing unhealthy, but other than that I ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted. Still nothing. No gains. I actually lost weight. So I added protein shakes, with peanut butter, ice cream, chocolate syrup and more peanut butter. That worked a little bit. I wasn’t trying to gain weight per se, just to get stronger. More muscle. But in order to do that, the side effect was indeed, weight gain. Which was great in my opinion. But then people started making comments about how much I’d gained and that I better watch my girlish figure etc. But I didn’t want a girlish figure, I wanted to be a frickin BEAST. So fast forward to three years later, and I develop a health issue that forced me onto the strongest birth control pill out there. So I gained the weight I wanted! I gained 50lbs in one year! I’m now around 140 at any given time, and I couldn’t be happier! I’m not going to lie, my anorexic mind still speaks up sometimes and calls me “fat” or “overweight” etc but I quiet that with more food! I still eat healthy, because that’s just who I am. But I eat like a normal person now, I mean like, I eat every single day now instead of every three days! Wow. That’s great. I’ve taken up powerlifting even, and I lift HEAVY weights. I’m so proud of myself. But people are CONSTANTLY commenting about where I used to be and where I am now and they ask me if I miss my figure and my thin body. I do sometimes, I miss being able to fit thru two desks without my booty gains knocking everything off of one of them lol and I miss how simple life was when all I was eating was a single egg on a corn tortilla every three days. But I’m happier now. What I don’t miss is hating myself, and the constant aching in my gut, and losing my period. I may be a little fluffier today, but I’m a lot stronger (inside and out). Today I’m clean, I’m proud and I feel human for the first time in years instead of feeling like some monster that people really admired...for some odd reason. It still baffles me how that sickly body was worshipped and my healthy body is shamed now tho. Who knows why? I don’t and I don’t really care at this point. Instead I deadlifted 300lbs last week, and then ate a burger. 🤷🏻‍♀️
