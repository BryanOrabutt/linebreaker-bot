My father worked on the cleanup crew at the Chernobyl disaster so every year we go there to look around and say hello and apparently this year someone was going around to all the guard stations and stealing cameras and monitors he had already stolen from the place that we’re going to sleep at so we weren’t worried that was until around 3 AM I had gotten up to go to the bathroom near a guard station there was a portable toilet right next to the guard station that I used I was planning on talking to the guard but when I came out he wasn’t there so I looked around to the main building which is right next to a small creek that runs into the Chernobyl cooling pond I rounded the corner and found myself looking at a guy who’s sprinting full speed and knocked into me sending us both off of the bank into the water The guy screamed something in Russian I believe it was and I started throwing a punch but I had landed on my back and got the wind knocked out of me and couldn’t really fight him so then he stood up over me and raised his foot up to bring it down on my head t though 0 fuck I’m gonna drown in this fucking river and then I heard a deafening crack one of my ears I was above water started ringing in the guy that was standing over me stumbled backwards a few feet and then fell hard on the ground I could see in the flood light that half his face is gone and the guard is standing on the top of the bank with a gun I don’t remember what happen next but next thing I knew it was daytime and I was getting asked questions by ambulanceParamedic whatever you wanna call it apparently the guard at saw me getting knocked into the river and was about to get my head stopped in so he shot him in the head The trials in a few days to see if it was lawful or not is probably going to be but the guy was pretty messed up and it fuck me up really badly
