so  during the summer of 2019 i used to have a grindr account where i just talked to guys cuz i was lonely and looking for someone. there were some guys who used to ask for my snap and i gave it to them so we could talk, but we usually stopped talking within a week. except this one guy, who i used to talk to on and off up until last november. thats when we started talking more seriously, and i found out we actually share many things in common. we were both the same age, both liked video games and were looking into similar careers. i liked him and he seemed like a really sweet guy. the catch was that we lived 4 hours away. this didnt seem that bad, but both of us were broke 18 year olds that couldnt drive. but we still kept talking. i remember telling him that if this long distance thing doesnt work out that i at least want to remain as friends, as he was a cool guy and i didnt want to loose him, only for him to tell me to not say that, as he really wanted this work out. we had plans to meet up this january, but we changed it to late feb cuz on january money was a little bit thight. but i was still looking forward to seeing him in person. unfortunatly for the past month he was acting distant. he never messaged me first and only sometimes responded to the things i sent him. i asked why he was acting a little bit distant and he responded with asking what he was doing that made me think that. i let it pass because i have a tendency to over think stuff and i was going through the january blues at the time. this took a toll on my until yesterday night where i sent him a happy valentines message just to be left on read. that shit just broke my fucking heart. i know this wasnt a serious relationship, but to be ignored by the person that you really admire really fucking hurts man, especially since ive been feeling like total shit lately. i dont know what to do. ill just ignore him and if he asks anything ill just tell him that whatever we had is over.
