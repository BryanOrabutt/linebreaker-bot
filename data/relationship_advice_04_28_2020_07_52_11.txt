So I’ve known this girl since her freshman year I was a sophomore but I broke up with my ex and my ex had some people try and jump me and out of all my friends she was the only one to tell a principal even though they all knew so I was thanking her and shit and we got to talking she’s cute and sweet and cool I see no reason I shouldn’t date her but she is extremely innocent we joke around about sex all the time I went to her house and I could see why they’re a religious family but in the basement there’s half naked calendars and almost porn pics up and her mom even said damn she got big tits to her dad so it’s not surprising but what I mean by innocent is she knows the basics of sex only like hole penis in out but the more we talked the more she got more and more innocent that’s not the problem though sex is nice but not everything but then she also tells her parents everything and I mean everything she said if I asked her out she’d have to ask her parents first which to me is kinda weird but not extremely weird but the thing is one day I sent her a pic of my bulge in my underwear one day and a week later she was showing all our friends the picture just to prove that she’s not as innocent as we think cause she asked for it I’m mixed but I got visibly red and was sweating and was embarrassed asf later I explained it to her and it took her a bit to realize what she did was embarrassing to me that’s my struggle I’d be cool with dating her if she didn’t tell everyone out business I know if we were together nothing would be just between us it’d be between us her best friends our friends and her parents which is kinda annoying another thing is she’s white and likes white dudes she’s not exactly what I like either but it’s not a big deal really tl:dr I don’t know if I should date this girl she’s pretty good and nice but she doesn’t keep anything a secret I sent her a risqué picture and she showed all of our friends should I date her or no
