Ok so I've had SAD my whole life, well since I can remember and it would affect me physically to the point where even if I want to talk, I can't. My mind kinda shuts down/becomes blank and then I start crying. It's extremely embarrassing and exhausting since it can last up to 5 hours of constant crying and hyperventilation and I don't know what to do about it. I've tried medication and therapy, but everything I've tried lost it's effectiveness after about 5 months of usage even on higher dosages or it would make it worse. It just frustrates me to no end cause the only things that make me happy in life is art, helping others and talking to people...fookin ironic, yea I know. Anyway as you can imagine it's quite hard for me to be happy and I am freakin sick of it. I have a good life, a loving family and just no excuse to be the way I am. My own body feels like a prison and I can't ask anyone in my life for advice since I have a breakdown before I can even try. I want to make other people happy. I want to be happy. I want to pick up a piece of trash on the sidewalk without feeling like I'll have a panic attack out of some stupid fear of being watched. Sorry for the rant, I'm just kinda worried that I'll never grow out of it cause I have made progress in the past like being able to ask one of my friends if I can lend a pencil in class or even being able to do a speech for class and only having a breakdown at the end, but it just keeps resetting or getting worse. It scares me and I don't know how I'm going to make it through my matric exam I've already had an attack while having to write a story which is total bullshite since I love writing stories, well except the part where someone else has to read them, but oh well...Anyway does anyone have advice for me? My 18th is getting real close and I really don't want to go to university with this problem, or atleast have my reactions be a bit more manageable. Hope you have a wonderful day thoughâœŒ
