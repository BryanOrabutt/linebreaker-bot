So first off major props to Eric Voss and NR  for making notice of something that now I've watched it 10 more times am sure James Gunn gave us a literal sign to pay attention. In the opening scene we see a young Peter sitting in silence and as the shot focuses in on him if you look at the nurses station there's actually a sign that says Visitor Pay Attention. Understanding now that we are watching a side love story playing out it becomes clear that it's meant for us the audience, so to the point if the tape is not just a love letter to Peter but a story of her journey and the truth about who he is told in true quill fashion through music. Okay and what if that side story is playing out like a opera with each song having a connection to the location that we hear playing while either there;on the way;or leaving for example The KYLN coordinates translated to this is not real and while Starlord made his escape we hear a song not only about getting away, but the main  premise is about two lovers who are trapped in something that is a lie a relationship that isn't real, and of course we know "hooked on a feeling" played as they we arriving and it's a song about someone being head over heels in love with not a actually person but technically just the rush they get from believing someone loves them something else that's not real. Following this notion I decided to first log out all locations and coordinates in volume 1 and 2 . Then my daughter wanted to watch her favorite Captain Marvel after a heated debate I bowed out and in doing so had a thought Peter got snatched in 1988 right so that means that ravengers ship had to make a jump to earth and then back okay keep up because this is where I need help. In 1989 the kree somehow I want to assume because of the fanz lunch box find Marvel after let's 15 to 20 years of looking and based off the galaxies opinion of earth we trash so why all of a sudden check earth because of Peter okay is anyone's intrest peeked so one connection that has weight I searched for more and if you're thinking about it you should came to my next conclusion the kree but not just the kree 2 very specific kree that if you truly think about it had absolutely no impact on the plot of the movie and the plot thickens so now I realize Captain marvel gives the coordinates to key locations that could and please someone do be deciphered and go with the puzzle, but it's the last wall I hit that I really think I the crown jewel and honestly the the most well hidden message. No matter how many times someone arrives outside of earth they never give coordinates of we can assume the writers were like everyone should know this is earth, but wouldn't that 4kinda deadpoolish for the narrator to basically break the fourth wall and acknowledge the audience is from earth. Then I realized they give coordinates for Marvel's lab and if you pay attention they absolutely run the planets numeric name into the ground and just a little more support the lab is the only location that has its coordinates,( and if you think about it that was the underlying plot of the movie to get those coordinates )that is not a planet our a massive warship and to make it more suspect its also the only one that doesn't have the alphabetical/numerical identifier such as the one for earth that they run into the ground . Then the kitchen conversation where a shape shifting genius alien can't figure out the coordinates aren't on earth but in space so long story short if one of you super smart math people would decode the lab coordinates 5229-478,7680,2 and then and on earth alphanumeric code I think we may get a large clue into Meredith Qull. Other coordinates TORFA P137.T55412AS+C00876, HALA 8K1M.YY67A47+58E698L
