This December something very strange happens in my life. One night I was spending the night at my grandmas house when house sitting. In the room I was sleeping in I was surrounded by old photos of my grandmas parents, so my great grandparents. My GG’s died when I was very little, to the point where I don’t remover my great grandpa and the only memory I have of my great grandma was her in her coffin at her funeral. Anyways, I was at my grandmas falling asleep when I open my eyes towards the ceiling and see a dark figure lowering down towards my face. Of course, I yell and the whole ordeal is over. Th next night, I had a dream. In my dream, my great grandparents were old and in a bed, and I was taking care of them. I saw their faces and heard their voices. They each have me a box, and in each box we’re films of memories of their lives. I remember watching my great grandmas films and having to reluctantly watch the stage of her life where she declines, and then I even remember watching my great grandpas films of drawings and boats from when he was young. That was the only dream that I had with them in it. For the month continuing the dream, I would be laying in bed in my phone or falling asleep and then see a figure near my closet or my bed. I would get so scared and yell and shine my flashlight in the direction. It was always nothing. One night I turned and swore I saw a figure a foot away from my bed. These happened 2-3 times a week for about a month. They stopped after a dream that was the opposite off seeing into the past. I had a dream that only seemed about five seconds long. It was me driving in the dark, seeing a deer on the side of the road, then slamming in my breaks. The next day, I was driving in the dark and I saw a deer on the side of the road in the same landscape as my dream, and I slammed on my breaks. Then my figure visits stopped. What does all of this mean?
