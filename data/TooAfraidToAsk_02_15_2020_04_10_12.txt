I used to have friends in middle school 6 of them at most and it was like one of the best few years of my life socially because I felt like I belonged and was part of something. One day my mom after being paralyzed for 9 years died and it motivated my dad to get us to live on a sail boat. I tried to squeeze as much time as possible with my best friend until we moved on a boat. In the middle of eighth grade I spent my last day at an actual school without knowing (since my dad wanted to surprise me) and I got signed up for virtual school in preparation for the boat phase. Once we sold the house and moved on the boat, I had already been doing virtual school for almost a year and 9th grade was about to start or freshman year which depressed me because I knew that I wasn’t going to see my friends as much or make any new ones. When 9th grade started, all of my friends who I kept in touch with on snapchat had made so many new friends that I could see them on there snapchat story and see them have so much fun while I just sat in my small as cabin at 12 am wishing I was with them. Eventually my original friends stopped talking to each other since they moved to separate high schools and stuff and I have only talked to my best friend Jaden but not even that much. Ever since my dad moved us on the boat, we have barely come across any kids my age who also lived on a boat (to be exact, I have only come across and talked to 3 kids in person for almost an entire year one of which being a girl my age that I liked but my developing social anxiety fucked it up for me, the other being the girl’s brother who was 6 years old and this one girl my age that my family met who was extremely weird). I have started to become more antisocial which I knew would happen and I have pretty much lost all of my friends so what should I do? I mean 99.99 percent of all boaters are retired old people especially in Florida. I am in desperate need of someone to talk to that is my age in person. Any advice?
