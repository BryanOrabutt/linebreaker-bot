A reader  not a poster but here i go. Im 33f. My life changed on this path of a rollercoaster when i was 18. Ive dealt with drug over doeses and heart breaks. On april 14th i will have hit a huge mile stone. October 1 of 2018 i applied for a government job. I got it on april 14th 2019 and its been a full year of training nearly. My relationship with my boyfriend since 2014 of sleeping on the floor and being a servant to his family not having any privacy took its toll. I found my own apartment march 17th 2017.  I moved in literally 2 blocks away and then i still had hope for him to visit me but he had other priorities. Christmas eve 2019 i had enough. To many tears every night. I left a job for him when he asked me to and i sufferd at a toxic one because he thought it was good for me. Ive built a solid wall around my heart and wanted more for myself. Ive realised what i knew all along that i could make it on my own. Now that i have the good job he is suffering and gitting up my phone every day asking for money and help. I think of when his children disrepswxted me and raised a crow bar to me threating me. I think of the endless nights of working 16 hours and just wanting to go to sleep but i couldnt because his own mom said oh shes watching tv in the frontroom.....the floor i was sleeping on..smh....i paid hakf rent and sometimes her half.. i was given no key to a place i was paying half for. .....listen all i want to say is that im on my way. I never would have dreamt i have what i have right now. To blessed to be stressed. Ive worked to hard to get where i at. I am okay and i will be okay. Im realizing that right now and im so humbled and thankful beyond words. I was so ready to give up and i swear everything changed in a day with one application. I am worth it and i deserve it.
