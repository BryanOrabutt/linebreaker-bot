I was hoping to make it like the first half of part one we follow maul on tattoine and the next half is him finding kenobi and then having to team up to defend Owens farm from a tusken raid and at one point maul having to save obi wan from a tusken raider then in part two I want it to be about the obi wan and maul catching up on life and discussing what has led to this point in their lives and at one point I want obi wan to invite maul for tea and discuss their ideology’s and beliefs on the Jedi order and the sith and I also want them to discuss the drive of mandalor and maul confronting him of why he didn’t show up to face him i want pure tension and how if obi wan says one thing to tick mual off things could get deadly I want the general theme of this arc is to let go of the past and obi wan trying to convince mual to let things go and obi wan forgiving mual for what he’s done to his life but mual doesint let go and challenges obi wan to a duel to the death to satisfy he’s vengeance at first obi wan says no but mual threatens Luke and says that he well make him his new apprentice so obi wan with no other choice agrees to the duel and would take place at night in the sand I want them to have a proper duel band at one point have maul beating up obi wan but Luke shows up and knowing obi wan is in danger force pushes mual and faints obi wan rushes to go see if he’s ok and gets more serious and the battle continues I want to have mauls death the same like he throws sand into his eye and goes for the killing blow like he killed qui gon but obi wan uses the force and doges and stabs maul I want it to be like qui gone death with him saying train the boy and he well avenge us after mual dies Luke wakes up and forgets everything and says what happened obi wan says go back to your uncle Owen the episode ends with obi wan barring mual and looking into the twin suns and looking at Luke play in the sand  and the episode ends. Do you think I should do it I have nothing else to do I also feel like the episode was ruined with Ezra and chopper just tell me if I should try.Also I know didn’t worry I well have proper punctuation and spelling if I do make it just say no or sure do it
