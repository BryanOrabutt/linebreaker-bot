So I(F14) liked this guy(M15) from church for a while(I’ve known him since 2016) and we were in a soccer group chat together, so I decided to message him. At first I just said “Hey” and he left me on read so later I send 8 ball and we played it, then we played some more games. They went over a lot of days because he isn’t on his iPod that much so after a game we both said good game and that was it. A week or two later, I get a text from him and it was another game(Knockout) and we played then I sent Cup Pong. We played for a little bit, then he left me on read again. A few days later I texted him and asked if he had fun at a youth group event we were at that night, and he left me on read. Then, I was on a youth group trip and he didn’t come, so I asked why, and he left me on read a few days later. Later that summer, I snapped him and told him happy birthday because snap said it was his bday, and he left me on opened😂 but, throughout all this, we did yg and soccer together and he liked my posts on insta and viewed my stories and everything. Eventually, I gave up and started liking someone else. Keep in mind, this was all last summer. Soooo fast forward to this winter, I had been joking with my friends that I was gonna ask why he left me on read or tell him it was his game or whatever, but they were all like no and I didn’t. Well, today, I was sitting with my cousin and I was joking with her that I was gonna do it after communion and just lean up to him and ask(he was sitting in front of me and we had shaken hands during the greeting) but then we just said we’d do it after. So close to the end of the sermon, I was getting nervous and was like ha I’m not gonna do it, because I never go through with anything. So I JOKINGLY asked my cousin if she’d do it for me, and she’s like oh yeah of course I’ll ask so she went up to him and she was like “Lily’s curious why you didn’t respond” and he was so confused and was like oh I didn’t get it and looked through his messages and was like yeah I don’t have any from you so I pulled my phone out and showed him and he was like oh I got a new iCloud thing(email) so that’s why and he asked if I was in a gc and I said no but I was in a old one and he’s like I don’t have that anymore but you can resend it so then I still didn’t have the right email so I just asked my friend for it so then I texted him this afternoon and it still hasn’t delivered😂 so yeah that was interesting and I wanted to share my story lol
