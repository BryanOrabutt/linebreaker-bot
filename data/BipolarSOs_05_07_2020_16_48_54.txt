I’m currently in a long term relationship with my girlfriend (both F/20) and things have gotten pretty hard lately. I think it all started when she started telling people in front of me that she was planning on starting school in the spring when we had been planning on moving across the country together this summer and she knew I wanted to leave my hometown cause of bad family situations/no support. It hurt me pretty bad cause I feel like I always think about her and include her in my plans but she was so quick not to with me and didn’t think twice about how I would feel about staying in this city another 2 years??? We ended up breaking up for a day but then she apologized a bunch and said she said all the wrong things and that it was unintentional but now things haven’t been the same for a couple weeks. We’re very distant with each other, barely texting, not talking to each other when we are going thru it when we both know via social media. When we are together it’s still not the same we both get pretty quiet for no reason and I just let it get to me so I just get really quiet at certain times cause I overthink things. I just don’t feel as comfortable with her anymore and I don’t know what to do about it. I feel like our relationship is really unfair cause I do so much for her and don’t really get much in return. A part of me thinks I am dramatic and am asking for so much of her which some of my friends have told me but all I want is to be cared for the way I care for her? Not sure what to do she wants to meet up later today and talk and I don’t even know if I wanna be in this relationship anymore if things are gonna continue being like this. Mind you before all of these we had the purest relationship I’ve ever had and we’re so head over heels for each other obv by planning our future together. Now I don’t know where I stand. Any advice on how I can fix things or should I just stop putting in effort and move on?
