I traveled through time last night. I dreamt that my two friends and I, we will call them Melanie and Lori, we went to an antique show and found an old painting that was cursed with power. We wanted this power and tried to get into the painting, but a woman who was guarding it came up and yelled at us to scram. So we did, but my friend Melanie decided to go back by herself. She alone is smaller than Lori and I, and she was able to sneak easier. Before you know it she was gone. Lori and I randomly fell through a portal in the ceiling of Melanie’s childhood bedroom and we were in a room with a baby crib and baby toys. We saw Melanie, but she wasn’t an adult anymore.. she was an young child. I don’t quite remember what happened after that but the next thing I do remember is that Lori and I appeared on this cloud in space, as if we were stuck there. No way out. We had to wait for Melanie on earth to make the move and find out how to get herself out of it. We were there for what felt like years until A rainbow appeared out of the cloud. Melanie was there back as now her regular young adult self. She yelled “come on guys! We’re going home!” And we slid down this rainbow and I landed on the couch in my parents home. I was still the same age I am now, but nobody else was. My mom was in her mid 20s, my brother who is 5 years older than me was now a little boy of probably 7 or 8, and then I saw myself... she was in a pink onesie and her brown hair in her face.. she was only 2 years old. I asked her if I could hug her and she said “well.. I don’t know you..” but mom said to her “it’s okay” and I picked little me up and sat her in my lap and hugged her. I told her that she was me and I was her. Then I woke up and I feel so tired. I feel like our energy gets drained from our dreams sometimes. And I wonder too, did I really go back in time? Or was this all just a dream? I felt like I definitely entered the Twilight Zone.
