Han, both BB8 droids, Luke, Iden, and Boba Fett are so over powered in HvV! It ruins the entire game mode! All Luke does is dodge until his force push recharges then he charges over and over till he kills you. Hans shoulders are made of steel so he can shoot you as you approach and then knock you to the ground when you get close enough to attack him with a lightsaber and shoot you till you get back up and repeat. Iden can roll infinitely it seems like, as she slowly whittles your health down with 2 or 3 shots followed by a roll and all Boba does is fly around shooting rockets the entire match. BUT the WORST thing of all is the GOD DAMN BB8 DROIDS!! Whoever decided to add these to the game should be fired and never hired at a developing company again. If your in the middle of fighting someone and one of these fuckers rolls up you won’t even be able to see them because they are to small to show up in your field of view. Then out of no where you get whipped like the disrespectful slave you are to EA or zapped halfway across the map like BB8 posses an all powerful form of sith lightning! And the dark side one is just as bad. On top of the bullshit amount of health and attack power they have, the dark side one is part of vape nation and completely covers the entire battlefield in fat clouds. This wouldn’t be so much of an issue on its own but the droids are already way to hard to see/attack as it is. On top of that the outline of the droid completely disappears in the smoke which means they can roll their short asses right up behind you and start the process all over again. Does DICE even play this game? The BB droids were CLEARLY added as some kind of fan service or cash grab and the result is an utterly broken droid with the power of a Jedi! And this isn’t even including how game breaking the damn things are in GA or Supremacy. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF BATTLEFIELD DICE/EA REMOVE THE BB8 DROIDS!!!!!!!!
