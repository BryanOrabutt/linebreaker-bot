My boyfriend (25 M) and I (23 F) have been together for almost a year and a half. Weve always had a great relationship, and things have been beautiful until about a month or 2 ago. Hes been super distant lately and it really started to get kinda bad when I caught him in a lie. He told me he was hanging out w his friends(was around 4 am) and then he didnt answer for a while. Ended up asking the supposed friend he was with and dude said he hasn't spoken to my bf at all that day. Later found out that he stayed the night at a female coworkers house. I was pissed, not bc he was hanging w another woman but bc he felt he had to lie to me about it. I voiced why I was upset, we talked, and I caught him in another lie not even a week later. Same situation, he left around 7am, said he was hanging w some friends, and later found out he was at that same womans house. Which, obviously raises suspicion to me. We get over it, and talk shit through. I still have some doubt in my mind and found an old jerkoff vid that he previously sent to me the beginning of our relationship in his trash folder on his phone. I obviously know what should be done, but part of me cannot let go of the fact that him and I were so good for the majority of our relationship, and I'm unsure why there's been a sudden change of things out of nowhere. Part of me thinks I'm over reacting, the other part of me thinks that hes cheating on me and its heartbreaking to even think of that considering weve discussed our future together in depth. I'm unsure how to go about things or how to make things better. I told him a few days ago that if he wants to leave, I wouldnt stop him if that's what he truly wants to do and he stated hed like to work things out with one another. I hate this whole situation, but I'm completely in love with him even though I clearly see red flags that I'm trying to ignore.
