So my relationship with my parents is a bit mixed. My dad and I weren’t really close but an accident happened to me while i was away at college and he’s gotten closer to me since then (ie increased communication, more trust, etc.). My mom on the other hand is kind of the opposite. We were really close while I was in college and stuff and I thought everything was going to be okay when I came home (the incident caused severe mental trauma so I have to take a term off of school to get back on my feet), but when I get home, she’s been kind of unpleasant to be around. I offered to help her open a bag of chips for her and right after I opened, I was going to hand it to her but she literally snatched it out of my hands and laughed. When I was eating dinner with her at the house, I asked her to get a cup for me really politely and then she got really upset and told me about how long of a day she’s had and like I get she’s had a long day, but it’s not like my day wasn’t ass either. I have to work through so much of my own stuff and it’s just really frustrating. It’s all these little things that she does that are so rude and I know she would never do this to my older brother so why me? She also doesn’t really take my mental illness seriously. Ever since November (the incident happened in September and was left untreated until January), I’ve been losing large amounts of weight (involuntarily) and she hasn’t been very kind or very helpful about it. I want to tell her all these things but everytime I tell her something she doesn’t like to hear, she just doesn’t listen to what I have to say and I don’t want her to get even more upset with me. I want to recommend maybe family therapy but then she will ask why and it’ll be a whole ordeal. I really feel stuck and I just really don’t want to spend time with her anymore. Idk what to do anymore except stay holed up in my room and go down when I need something.
