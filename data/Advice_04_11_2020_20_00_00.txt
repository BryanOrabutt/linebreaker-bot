So I (20F) went to a party on Halloween weekend, and drank too much and this one guy at the party started making out with me. That was fine whatever, he kept pulling my skirt up and I told him to stop and he kept doing it. Anyway we end up ubering back to campus together with a few of my friends. He kept asking me to go back to his room but I wanted to make sure my Roomate got home ok, so he came with me to walk her home. When we got there he kept trying to convince me to go back with him and I was essentially saying no I think (I don’t really remember, I just remember saying I didn’t want to hook up with someone who doesn’t actually like me) but he kept persisting and was making me feel bad. I ended up going back with him and set a limit of only giving him oral, which once again was only because I felt bad for saying no to going back. When we got there before anything happened he asked me if I was still drunk and I said yes (which I was, not black out but very wobbly on my feet and I didn’t remember certain points the next day) and then I asked if he was and he also said yes but I’m thinking he only said this because I said I was. Anyway I started giving him oral and he started trying to finger me, and I eventually gave in to having sex with him. Like I said yes to having sex with him. Ever since that night, starting immediately after, like the next day, I’ve been worried about being pregnant because while I do remember insisting on a condom, I have black memories of seeing it go on. He didn’t finish in me, and I know for sure because I gave him oral sex again to finish but I don’t remember seeing a condom come off. It’s been like six months and I have had my period 6 times and have taken countless pregnancy tests all negative. I’m mentioning this because my question is, is this sexual assault? Is thag why I have so much anxiety pertaining to the situation? One part of me thinks it is, but then I did say yes. Is it sexual abuse, or was I just taken advantage of?
