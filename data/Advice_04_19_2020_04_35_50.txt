I have been going to youth group for the past year and all the kids and leaders are so nice to me and welcoming and a lot of them are my best friends. But my Youth pastor never seemed to like me. I don’t even think I did anything to offend him and he has known me since I was little. His wife is one of my biggest role model because she is a pastors kid as well. Every time I enter the same room as him he gets quite like he doesn’t want me to be there and he talks to EVERYONE but me. I don’t know if I just need to find a reason to talk to him and have a connection or what. But My youth group is medium size about 25 kids each week and I don’t even go every week because I live far. He talks and is so nice to everyone and I’m the only person who he doesn’t talk to and gives the cold shoulder also a lot of times I’ll just be standing there and he just push me to get by. Everyone has a special relationship with him and I’m just feeling like I’m not welcomed by him. Especially now since We are on zoom for yg and I can join every week he is all happy but then when I join he looks disappointed and the fact is I brought my friend one time to yg and he LOVED her and that kinda hurt because I used to look up to him and I love his message but  now I don’t even want to join yg stuff because of him. My cousins use to go a long time ago and one was his favorite and one he had trouble with because she doesn’t know how to be quite sometimes and I don’t know if he expects me to be like the trouble maker or what but I just want to be me. Also I got saved and he really didn’t care. The girls are supposed to be his favorite but I’m a girl and I get the cold shoulder while both guys and girls get praised from him and at this point I don’t know what to do and I need him because if I confront him about it then he probably will tell the rest of the kids in youth group and make me sound like I am a brat.
