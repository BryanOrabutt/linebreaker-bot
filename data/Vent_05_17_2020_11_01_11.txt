A bit of history about me I’m 17 living overseas as a military child. A year ago my parents almost got divorced my mom blamed it on me so my dad. They went to counseling soon after and it got back to normal. Lately they’ve been talking to me about college and I told them I don’t know what I want to do my future. They’re pushing me to do online school but that won’t be good for me I struggle with doing online currently. I told them I want to start a clothing business with hand made clothes, just a small one. My mom immediately turned me down saying I would not be able to do that to go to college get a stable job and then maybe do that for fun. My mom criticizes me for so much and it makes me feel like I have to be a different person. She tells me that I sometimes look childish or homeless when my clothes my hair or my look doesn’t meet her standards. Whenever I don’t wear make up she says that I look ugly and not put together. I’ve struggled with eating all my life. Certain textures I cannot eat it will make me throw up. Causing me to not eat many normal foods such as sandwiches and pizza. I cannot control this but my parents say otherwise and that I do it for attention. Why would I fake my eating habits which has caused me to lose friends and miss out on things in life. I cannot cry in front of my parents they will yell at me and call me a crybaby or wine bag saying that I’m not mature and that nobody has died and I haven’t been hurt. My mom treats me as a child acts like I need to be an adult. Tells me to not compare myself to others but yet compares me to her all the time. She makes me self-conscious and not comfortable with myself makes me feel like I cannot do anything in life that I will end up being a failure. I don’t know what to do about this it’s so much and I don’t know who to talk to. I know this event hasn’t had much point but I needed to get it off my chest.
