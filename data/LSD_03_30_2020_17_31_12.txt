Just got a freshly iced dose of ego death thought i’d write this down if i ever become a youtuber or just to be interesting in general. It was January 25th Friday, deciding to continue my wake n’ bake adventures I hit on my dab pen probably the hardest I have ever in my life. But this time, it was different I was gone. Completely fucking gone lol, like I was going to get ready for school but then I realized I had forgotten who I was and what I had to do. And then I heard another voice it sounded eerily familiar. It was myself, but I wasn’t speaking as myself I was speaking as my older sister. She told me “Faruq why are you doing this everyday.” and that “You need to get out of the bathtub and and call the police.” I didn’t even notice myself getting up and stepping out I just did what  was commanded. But right when I picked up my phone I realized no one was telling me what to do. At this point I forgotten I had taken a substance. And reality itself didn’t even feel real I thought I was still sleeping but I kept on hearing this music. This Vivid music from this show called ‘Death Note’ but I remembered I saw the episode last night so I assumed all o this was just a dream but here was the problem. It **wasn’t.** Each second I kept losing my grip to reality I felt that I was already dead. But since this wasn’t my first time my weed primal instincts kicked in and I rushed to the a mirror. But this was the beginning of my nightmare. I looked in the mirror and I saw myself but then I looked again into my eyes I saw how tired and weak and lazy my body has gotten. And then I heard a voice it wasn’t just any voice it was my mothers she told me “People who do this all the time forget who they are.” That shattered my world completely but it wasn’t over when I was given a killing blow from one more person which was my true self my “ego.” He told me this “This is your hell you chosen not to care what happens after you die and for that your hell is to never know what happens if you die nor will you know if this is a dream or not.” I went full psycho I ran down to the basement which was arguably the worst place thinking I was stuck in a dream cause none of that can happen in real life right? But for me I have a full body mirror in my basement which made this nothing but worse I felt as if I was stuck. And yes, I did call my friend who we are going to call Steven. At this point I felt so dumb and lost because I had nothing inside me no will no personality I was a pure shadow of my former self. I called and asked him if I was alive and him being him didn’t take it so seriously and hung up. But the weird part was how I was speaking to him I spoke words with no meaning I just felt so empty. (At this point I was still naked) I looked at the mirror and this was by far the most nerve racking experience of my life (up to now). I saw him, I saw ***it.*** It was almost as if he was waiting for me and he knew this was going to happen. He told me that this hell was only going to last for two hours and that it was all a dream and that I was going to wake up. The only problem was I knew I couldn’t escape I knew it. I ran up stairs and told my mom I couldn’t go to school and that my body was paining me. But in the end I passed out I just accepted the fact that I was dead. In the end I truly realized that you are in fact your demon,your enemy, your hell. But, as long as you have the ability to strive forward you are in fact free, free of self and free to do as you wish.
