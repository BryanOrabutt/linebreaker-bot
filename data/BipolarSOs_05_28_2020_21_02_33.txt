Alright first off we’re both married so yeah I know that doesn’t help at all.  Affair has been going on for about a year and half now (few months of me ghosting him in between).  I’m 5 years older, he’s the one with Bpd, told me about this oct 2019...way after I was “in love” before this I’ll be honest I was clueless about bpd...so anyway dealt with a couple “mild” depressive episodes (after the manic ones) but then this last week has been one where he just literally cut me off.  I myself have high functioning depression and anxiety so yeah I overthink everything....this episode gave me time to literally draw out a timeline with dates of “special milestones” and “deep conversations” about leaving our current marriages (yes yes I know that would never work even if no mental illness was involved) anyhow I’ve come to conclusion after my little project and it hit me like a bus, it’s been mania all along not actual love that he’s been feeling but it was “real” for me...I’m not angry or mad, upset of course I’m devastated, heartbroken but I know he’s a good person with good intentions and it’s not he that set out to so this to me it was his manic self, he had no control over it so I can’t be pissed off or hate him...and now I’m losing my damn mind trying to cope with all this.  Like literally haven’t sleep more than 4 hours in the past 3 days and have stopped eating...which I know is due to the depression.  I know my situation is not unique so I just came here to try to figure out how long will I be heartbroken over a love that was just all in my head all along? I’m getting to the point where I feel so pathetic because I’m sinking and crumbling inside over something that literally was not real and he will carry on living among his mania, stability and depression cycles with no real idea what he put me through because he literally can not comprehend it.  I go back and forth between feeling this is so unfair and wanting to hate and resent him but I’m a empath so I settle down and realize it was not his intention, it wasn’t him it was the illness and I need to let it go and not internalize the negativity I’m carrying inside.  To top it all off my current husband noticed my depression and has been so kind and caring like he’s genuinely concerned...the best we’ve gotten along in years now and now the affair guilt is kicking in too.  Thank you to any of you kind souls that actually took the time to read this entire post. 💜
