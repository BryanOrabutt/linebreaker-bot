how can someone leave u so fast? how can u replace almost 2 years of such a strong connection and “love” with someone new that you barely know? like i was really so unimportant that you could replace me that fast?! i stg i used to know her, but her family slowly changed her into them basically. i think what kills me the most is that i can’t go back to be with the old her. or at least just be best friends because i miss her more than anything. i just want her to show up and tell me it’ll be ok. I MISS HER SO MUCH. i literally feel like the girl i loved died. it doesn’t feel like her anymore. 😞 now i just wish i could take it all back. i don’t want this stupid painful feeling in my heart, i don’t want to feel so betrayed by the ONE person i thought would always love me unconditionally and care and stay. she doesn’t try anymore. i have told her multiple times i want to get back together because i made a mistake (i broke up with her because we needed some time for ourselves) but she just DOESN’T TRY. HOW CAN YOU SIT HERE AND TELL ME YOU LOVE ME BUT GO AROUND BEING A HOE LIKE YOU TOLD ME YOU WEREN’T GOING TO DO. she’s always fucking lying to me. she doesn’t respect me. i’m still holding onto the girl that actually cared but the truth is she’s gone forever. what hurts the most is being so close and trusting her with EVERYTHING and she can just walk away from that like it’s nothing. like i’m nothing. how can any or us be happy or find love when real love is so rare these days. you hear all the time about people that have been together for 10+ years and break up because of cheating. HOW?!?!?!? i don’t understand. what is the fucking point in being with someone if you know they could replace you so easily. like you don’t matter, you’re just a piece on someone’s chess board. if they piece falls on the floor, they’re just going to leave you there and use a new one. i don’t think she understands that if it’s much longer before she changes her mind, i’m going to be out of here. and i won’t come back. the longer she does this to me the more i start to hate her and that makes me so fucking sad. how does any relationship mean anything when you know you could be replaced with someone else so easily. how do you people feel love knowing that? it’s not like i can’t move on, i can. but it’s the last thing i want to do. obviously if i have to i will, but nobody is ever going to be able to replace her. you guys don’t understand, it felt like we were the closest people in the world. now i just feel broken and betrayed and i honestly want to die because i don’t want a life where i get betrayed over and over again by the people i love.
