I’ve never posted on reddit before & this is going to be longish. Sorry in advance. My brother is a junkie. A heroin user. An addict. Whatever the fuck you want to call him. He’s 28 and I’m 25. It all started when we were younger I was 17 and he was 20. I noticed he started to mess around and take a pain pill he bought from friends here and there. He also smoked a lot of weed which wasn’t alarming. Even taking pills here and there didn’t alarm because it seemed as if everyone else did stuff like that all the time. Fast forward to when he’s 21 and he has a bad accident. He fell out of a tree and broke a bunch of things and cracked a vertebrae that could have been much worse and a bunch of ribs, concussion etc he got pain pills obviously. He basically just never stopped doing pills after that. Idk how it went from 0-100. It just seems like a haze. Suddenly one day, my brother, my best friend, was just addicted to pills. I didn’t think much of it even though I was concerned because he ALWAYS shit talked heroin users. He would make fun of people he knew from HS and say things like “I would never do heroin” and make fun of those people and say how disgusting they are etc. Fast forward again, I moved away. My mom and him came to visit me. He kept asking me how to get pills the whole time. I said I didn’t know because I don’t do that. He freaked out, ruined an entire vacation, and I literally sent him away on a bus to the airport after he blew up and started talking mad shit while apparently withdrawing from the pills.  He was the rudest, meanest, craziest person I’ve ever dealt with in my life. I didn’t even recognize him. That’s when my mom and I realized his addiction is much worse than we thought. Fast forward again, I moved back home. I immediately could tell he was a worse “druggie” than I thought and that my parents realized. I told them “he’s on heroin” they didn’t believe me and freaked out on me. Then he admitted it to me. “Yes I’m on heroin but I’d never shoot up. I’m afraid of needles. People who shoot up are disgusting” he said. I told my parents they freaked out. Then the truth finally comes out a few months later. He shoots up all the time. Suddenly now that we realized this things just got so bad so fast. He robbed my moms house blind. Stole everything of value from my dad. Stole credit cards and anything of value from my my grandparents and our other grandpa too. That’s not including the stuff he stole from me, my boyfriend, his ex friends, girls he met off dating apps, etc he would steal anything any way that he could. It got to the point I had severe anxiety and depression from his stealing. I was always thinking about how he could break in at any moment and steal. I’d sleep with my expensive belongings. I would lock stuff up in the house I was in that was already locked. I soon became the counselor of the entire family. Every time my phone rang it would be a family member crying to me about how he stole again. He’s probably all together stolen over $30,000 since his addiction began. Maybe more than that. From one person alone he’s stolen over $13,000. My family is super stupid. Here is how the cycle goes. He steals from my elderly grandparents. let’s say credit card. Spends $1500. They find out. He denies it as much as he can. Then he ends up admitting it after showing him we know for a fact it’s him. They don’t call the cops on him. He doesn’t care. Doesn’t say sorry. Grandma says for him to never come over ever again. 2 weeks later he’s back over to her house. He pretends to be super nice and “changed” and then steals again, she calls me crying saying he’s banned from her house forever. Rinse and repeat. Basically the same thing for my parents. My dad has never kicked him out. He says “he doesn’t want his son to die” even though he’s already died. And even overdosed in his home last month after getting out of a forced community service rehab thing. Now my brother has a almost 50 year old ex alcoholic girlfriend cashier who is living with him at my dads house. My dad just cries and cries and complains to me but never kicks them out. Never kicks my brother out no matter what even though my dad has nothing of value since it’s all been stolen. He feels like if he kicks him out he will just go kill himself. LOL 😂 who cares at this point honestly. He’s already dead pretty much. I show them all things that prove they’re the worst enablers in the whole entire universe. My mom is the least enabling one but she still enables but just not as much as everyone else. My brother has been in an out of jail for stealing for his drug habit. He’s now looking at 7 years in prison. He’s been to rehab multiple times and always gets kicked out. Kicked out for smuggling in alcohol. Kicked out for having sex. Etc Luckily, I don’t live in the same state as them anymore but they still call me to complain about all this shit. I really hate to say this and I’m probably going to get so much hate but I wish he’d just go to prison for SO long. Or just overdose without someone using narcan on him to save him. Just fucking end it already. Narcan is also enabling him. He can just plunge drugs into his veins and know if he did too much someone will just call a little ambulance with their “life saving drug” that will save him.  Just let him fucking die. He wants to die. He hates life. He hates himself. He hates his family. He makes our life a living fucking hell. He’s the biggest sociopath I’ve ever seen. He never has said sorry to anyone he’s hurt.  He hardly ever cries. He’s a cold hearted piece of fucking shit criminal ever since he became addicted to opiates. I used to love and care about my big brother so much. He was my best friend in the entire world. I miss him so badly. I don’t even know why I posted this. I just need to vent. Insult me if you need to. I just don’t give a fuck anymore.
