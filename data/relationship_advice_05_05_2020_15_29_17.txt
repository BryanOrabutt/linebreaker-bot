Feeling a bit lost. The thing is I’ve had this same problem since I was 15-16 I’m currently 20 male btw. Getting girls attention is not hard for me. I am considered attractive to them almost 90 percent of the time. I don’t think looks is my problem. I do have a little bit of confidence issues though. I get matches on tinder and I talk to majority of them. Half the time I get messaged first. My problem is I am to afraid to open up an be my true self. I’ll always try be to confident which makes me look rude/arrogant or I’ll just straight up not try. I know I’m doing this to myself but I can’t manage to stop it. I’m not so much afraid of rejection but more of being laughed at and ridiculed. Over all I’m a genuine,  nice guy. But like I said there’s either 2 ways I go about it. The first way is just not try an basically be stubborn with shit responses and the second way which is kind of over confident and maybe a bit rude. I can also talk to a girl for weeks on end with almost nothing happening I don’t mean sexual but just a phone call/or even meeting up for a coffee. I don’t know how to be romantic I am to afraid to make the first move in case I’ll be looked at as a “weirdo” or one of them sketchy guys. It’s not me but I’m sick of this same problem arising! I’m my own worst enemy an I can’t help it. So many opportunities I have had an for me just to let them go down the drain. I’m sick of chasing people away for my own protection. I just want to feel a connection between someone other than a family member or a friend. It’s such a fucked situation to be in. Do I need to develop some sort of “game”! Flirting isn’t really an issue but going further is. I don’t know what the fuck to do. Even though I’ve had experience before. This shit is just confusing the fuck out of me. I’m sick of the head games also. Some advice would be nice preferably from girls.
