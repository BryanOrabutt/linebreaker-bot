My ex broke up with me on New year's Eve because he was going away for work and didn't want to do long distance. I respected his decision and even though I wanted to "fight" for him I let him go. He would text me the first month very often and we met at the beginning of February. He told me this month was bad for him and indirectly expressed he missed me, told me I was the best one, and got a tattoo that featured a small crow to keep memory of me (I gave him a crow painting for Christmas). Asked if he could contact me in April, when he's permanently back in our town. I told him no, of course I was hurt that he didn't even want to try long distance and gave up on us over something so stupid. I regretted it so three days later I apologized for being mean and told him we should meet in April. He said it's okay and he takes the blame for everything and told me he will do it. Texted me once again two weeks later and it was the last time I heard from him. I won't contact him first because I have my pride, he dumped me, I won't be begging him to love me back. It's been a month since our last conversation and one day I've got curious if I will find him on a site designed mainly for sex dates (we met there, my account was a troll and his was "to find his friend on there"). I decided to just check it so it won't be bothering me no more. But I found him. And he's logging on this site every 3-4 days. One thing he told me on the day of our break up was to not go on this site ever again. We were supposed to meet up soon and probably get back together because I made it clear to him I don't want to be friends but he currently acts like our relationship was nothing and wants to see if he can get someone better. I really wanted to try and fix everything with him and want to believe he can explain himself and I can forgive him and we'll be happy again..?
