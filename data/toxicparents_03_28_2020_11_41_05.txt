Hi reddit! I (18F) need some advice or help with my situation. Just some context of my parents, they are super strict (I’m not sure if this will explain how strict they are but they are Korean). They never really let me go out to hang out with my friends. The only way I can is if I tell them I’m doing a project or I’m just going out to study. This is the only way I get out of the house. So last night, I asked my parents if I could go to a birthday party and they told me that I could (took a lot of convincing). I left at 6:00pm and around 9:30pm my mom called me and told me to come home right this instant. I refused to because I felt like it was unfair and I really wanted to get out of the house for a while because I’ve been stuck due to the coronavirus. I eventually just told her I’ll be home soon and she hung up on me and I stayed longer. Then I decided to just sleepover and around 2:30am, my dad texted and called me a couple of times. I was asleep during that. I woke up at 6:30am and saw the notifications and went home around 7:00am. I got inside and pretended I was asleep on the couch. My dad came downstairs and asked me where I was and when I came home. I told him I was sleeping on the couch and I came home at 12am he said “stop playing with me, I checked your room and the living room. we’ll discuss this later when everyone is awake”. I know I shouldn’t have lied but, if my dad knew the truth he would go bat shit crazy. He has anger issues so when he gets mad it gets scary real quick. Idk what the right move is here. The last time something like this happened, it affected my parents relationship. They stopped talking to each other for a long time. My mom would go to the library all day and wait for my dad to leave to work. She even tried to buy plane tickets to go back to Korea just by herself. It was a extremely stressful time in my life and I don’t want that happening again Bc of me. Please help me!!
