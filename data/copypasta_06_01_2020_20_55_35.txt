According to all known laws of God, there is no way a man shall lie with a man. It's actions invalidate the sanctity of marriage. The sinner, of course, sins anyway because sinners don't care what God says is sinful. Here, queer. Here, queer. Here, queer. Here, queer. Ooh, queer and here! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all LGBT's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got aids on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop crying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that jizz? - A little. Special day, gay-graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three gays gay school, three gays sin school. Those were pre-marital. Three gays college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did cum different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing your penis? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, be homophobic, you die. Don't waste it on a faggot. Such a faggot. I guess he could have just repented of his sins. I love this incorporating diversity into our day. That's why we don't need salvation. Boy, quite a bit of pride... under the the 7 deadly sins. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Gay-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished gays, please welcome Dean Faggwell. Welcome, New Pride City graduating class of... ...69. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at LGBTQRSTUV Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just degenerate. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and genitals inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Pride, a division of Sin and a part of the LGBT Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a gay, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Sin begins when our valiant porn Jocks bring the sin to the city. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... sin! - That man was hot. - He's my cousin! - He is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Pride, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of gay existence. These gays are stress-testing a new dildo technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of sin that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most gay jobs are small ones. But gays know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that gays, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in Hell. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're gays. We're the most sinfully degenerate society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Jizz Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Porn Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the Pride. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sinful freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the Pride, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a porn Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more porn than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Gays make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the guys see you wearing it. Those guys? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant.     Look at these two. - Couple of Pride Pedos. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a porn Jock. Yeah. Once a cop pinned me against a mushroom! He had a hand on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert Twitter. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a church patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A crossroads for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, faggot-boy? Are you gay enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Pride! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about cancel culture. You grab that pot, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the sin field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a big penis. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into sin! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into sin. Our son, the Twitter mobber! - You're gonna be a pot stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the tweets I have on Bill Cosby. I can't say anything right now. I'm gonna get a penis tattoo! Let's open some sin and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my asshole. Shave my dick. Shack up with a hooker. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Porn counting, hormone therapist, bruh beater, cancel culturer, front desk, church remover... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking pubes out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Post birth abortion attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax balls always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A faggot died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, i am so hard! Heating, cooling, hormone therapist, bruh beater, cancel culturer, singing, rapist number seven, pube coordinator, stripper supervisor, bigot wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the church patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that is reading Leviticus 18:22 today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, Hollywood deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling horny, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a church advisory today, and as you all know, gays cannot be seen in church. So be careful. As always, watch your holy water, crosses, Bibles, priests, icons, silver bullets and essential oils. Also, I got a couple of reports of epiphany water being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a demon! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, gay law number one, absolutely no talking to Christians! All right, launch positions! Fag, fag, fag, fag! Fag, fag, fag, fag! Fag, fag, fag, fag! Rainbow and rainbow! Hello! You ready for this, hottie? Yeah. Yeah, slap muh ass. Penis, check. - rainbow flag, check. - jizz pack, check. - fursuit, check. - Twitter rant, check. Shit my pants, check. OK, faggots, let's move it out! Pound those cheeks, you striped penis-suckers! All of you, drain those dicks! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! It's big! This is Blue Leader. We have cock and ball visual.
