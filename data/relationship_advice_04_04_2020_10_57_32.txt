So I’m in a ldr relationship for almost 9 months now we see eachother every month, I’m currently really hurt right now because me and my gf were on face time (she’s bisexual) and she told me she wanted to message a girl she used to have a crush on just to see how she’s doing because they haven’t talked since before we started our relationship. I got upset over this and hung up and texted her how that was so fucked up to do that to me and she told me she never had a relationship w her that it was a dumb crush she had when she was 13 (she’s 15 now) and she told me before she had a crush on her they were friends and that her intentions weren’t the way I was thinking and she told me she’s show me the whole conversation if she messaged her but this still hurt me and I got really mad and hurt and told her how that’s so wrong to do that and she ended up bringing it on me and telling me I hurt her by overreacting and it turned into a huge argument and I hurt her for being mad and upset and I honestly don’t know what is wrong anymore. I understand she even agreed to show me the whole conversation but I don’t even know tbh if I’m overreacting at all because they never dated and she actually doesn’t talk to her ex at all which is good so I’m trying to understand her point of view but at this point I don’t know anymore and I tried to communicate w her but she completely ignored my texts Nd replies minutes later w dry responses because that’s how she gets when she’s hurt and she just told me to let her sleep it’s just the weirdest part is in the middle of me stressing out Bc she wouldnt answer or seemed like she cared I asked her if she still had romantic feelings for me and she said “idk I’m hurt” and I asked her that question again later on Nd she says she doesn’t and she doesn’t want to break up she’s just hurt bad and honestly I’m confused and don’t know why she went back and fourth. This is just a mess and I can’t sleep right now it’s almost 4 am and I just need some advice on what to do because idk who’s in the wrong or if if overreacted and left her text the girl because my gf was honest enough to let me know she wanted to, I would appreciate all the advice
