I am so angry at you. You feel guilty? Yeah you don’t show it. You could’ve done something like apologize. You know what pisses me off? That me fact that when anyone complimented or flirted with me you told me to shut it down. And that meant cut them off. Tell them you had a partner. Basically tell them to leave me alone. But that girl who flirted with you? You told me that you just told her to you had a partner and that’s it. But god forbid it was towards me and you’d lose your shit. But no for her, you KEPT flirting or well you didn’t flirt but she flirted with you and you let her. ONE WEEK one fucking week when we broke up and one week you started talking to her sexually. And now? One month later a relationship? You can’t even fucking apologize for being so inconsiderate. “It was free this year” I DIDNT WANT YOU TO BUT ME ANYTHING. I JUST WANTED A HEARTFELT LETTER. THATS IT!!! You tell me I miss your touch I miss your skin I miss this I miss that. Fuck you. First apologize for the shit you did. EXPLAIN TO ME how you moved on so fucking fast? And explain to me how you wrap yourself around her? Do you know how bad that sounds? I can’t even get closure. You say you feel guilty. YOU SHOULD YOU FUCKING SHOULD. ONE MEASLY LETTER AND YOU STILL DIDNT APOLOGIZE. I’m not angry I’m not bitter. I’m anguished I’m so devastated that you didn’t treat me like that. Be happy you asshole. I’ve been nothing but nice yet you are still such an asshole. You still throw shit at my face. You took back your forgiveness you never forgave me. You feel guilty? APOLOGIZE. You don’t even have the balls to see this. I kind of hope you see this. Because I know damn well I won’t get closure. I REFUSE to cry. My sister spent a whole hour on my eyes. Enjoy yourself because you think I left you for somebody else but in all reality you left me for someone else. I fucking hate that. I want to say I hate you but I’m just so FUCKING ANGUISHED I WANT TI SCREAM AT YOU
