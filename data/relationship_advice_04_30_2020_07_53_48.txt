My husband and I have been married for a year now. About three months into our marriage I found out he had been talking to his ex girlfriend at the same time we were in a relationship. Because the relationship was new during the time he did this, I found it in my heart to get over it. But then over the rest of the year, I continued to find out about other things he was hiding or lying about. At one point while trying to get our newborn daughter to sleep, I walked into our living room, and walked in on him masterbating to old nudes a different girl that we both know sent him. After that I have continued to find out he has commented on women’s sex stories online and ask for “proof” of them. I tell him I don’t mind him watching porn but he hides it and lies about it still. And now during sex, he wants to watch porn. He knows how badly it hurt me the first few times he did it. But he continues to do it. I just want to do what makes him happy and keeps him satisfied but at the same time I am completely falling apart. I have lost any shred of self confidence or love I have for myself. I hate myself. I hate myself so much I’ve contemplated suicide. I’ve tried to leave him but he does not let me leave, and then he convinces me he will no longer hurt me. But I know he won’t stop. I love this man. He is the only person I’ve ever felt close to like I do with him, the only person I’ve ever felt truly meant for. But these things are withering those feelings away and I find myself spending more time hurting over not being good enough for him than I do loving him. We’ve talked about these issues many many times but it still continues and he just tries harder to hide things. Should I stay with him and just accept that he needs more than just me? Do I leave him even though he is in every sense my soul mate, aside from these issues? Please help. I’m getting desperate. I don’t know what to do anymore.
