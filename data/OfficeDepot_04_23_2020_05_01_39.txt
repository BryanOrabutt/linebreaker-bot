So idk about the other stores but my store doesn’t take any email jobs what so ever and have our customers send them to the self service center. This lady come in I explain step by step how to send the email and what emails can’t be sent and the whole thing not to mention we have it posted up on 6 8.5x11 signs and one 24x36 sign on the wall after her 1st print failed She came up to me and thew the papers down and scolded me on how she told me she didn’t know what to do and how she always get it printed out behind the counter at other stores. 1st off we are not other stores each one is ran differently and 2nd off we haven’t taken emails in over a year but I put on a smile and went to help her send the email correctly which just turned out she didn’t include the attachment simple mistake I helped her send it properly by opening the pdf file and sending it that way and went to walk away and she looked at me and I kid you not said well aren’t you going to print it out for me I don’t know what to do LADY did you not just print it out yourself I stayed with this lady for 10 minutes telling her exactly what to hit we get to the main print screen and I wait for her to hit the BIG GREEN print button and she looks and me and says what’s next I made direct eye contact and said you hit the print button like last time with out Breaking eye contact she raises her voice at me and says “WELL ARENT YOU GONNA TELL ME THAT” i smile and in the calmest nicest voice I could manage I say “ma’am I’m sorry I thought because you printed the 1st one out on your own you knew already what to do after I helped you send the email hit print then click continue when your printing is done check out choose your receipt and your good to go” then I walk away to help out another costumer with a fax damned if she didn’t walk up to me not one minute later and ask me why I left her to help another customer if she was there first..look around lady there’s only me my manager who’s in the back on the phone ordering us supply’s and my register who is helping out a costumer with a chair I’m the only one upfront to take care of all the other people who walk in. I send this fax and walk over and finish her print for her which consisted all of hitting continue I sit there wait for the job to print and she looks at me and says “ what’s next” oh idk maybe hit check out since your print it done she then asked me where is it 🤬 I hit check out for her print her receipt and hand it to her as she’s leaving she turns around and says “you need to work on your costumer service skills I was here first and needed help and you left me for another costumer see if I come back to Office Depot you may have lost a costumer” bitch please leave and never come back it’s self service lucky I didn’t charge you extra for my time a few minutes later a Couple comes in can’t speak or read a lick of English using google translate I gave them the instructions along with our flyer in Spanish they take a photo of the google translate instructions and do it all on there own thank me in the most wholesome warm hearted way and leave not problems or questions asked with our self service printers only being in English using icons as their guide...Americans are lazy... I like my non English speaking costumers better
