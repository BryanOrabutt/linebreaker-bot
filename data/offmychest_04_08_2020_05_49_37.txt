i’m an adult i don’t know how to be an adult. i’m in college but i don’t know if i’ll be able to graduate or if i’ll just flunk it like i did in highschool. i’m somewhat good at art now but not to the extent where i want it to be because i still make 10 million anatomy mistakes. i don’t know if i’ll ever get my dream job i don’t know how i’ll succeed in this life! sometimes i miss being a teenager because i feel like i missed something as i grew up. i think i miss the 2000’s where the internet was much simpler with its more innocent memes and not everyone was an internet addict and it was just my own little thing. i know i said i’m 23 but sometimes i feel like i’m emotionally 12. i miss blockbuster, i wish blockbuster was around. i used to just rent mediocre comedies while getting fat on caramel popcorn or cookie dough bites. there were so many mediocre movies i rented there. did you know you could also rent video games from blockbuster? i rented mario sluggers once but i wish i had just bought it because DAMN was that a fucking fun game. if i could get my wii to work, i could see if i can find the game online and then play it. sometimes i overshare because i’m a somewhat lonely person, and also that if i don’t take everything out of my head, i’ll forget about it later. also both of my grandmas got dementia, so it’s likely i’ll get dementia in the future. i’m hoping that i’ll at least try to ward it off by being as healthy as possible in my old age. i should be asleep by now but i have insomnia so i can’t sleep. i actually have an online class at 9 am and i missed my past online classes for the past couple of days. i don’t know how to fix that. maybe i could watch a sleep hypnosis video but i don’t know if i could feel still enough to stay focused. my mind is racing with too many thoughts right now. i want to go to my computer and write but i know i shouldn’t. okay i think i’m actually done now.
