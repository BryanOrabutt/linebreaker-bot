Since I was asked to update on the situation that went on with leaving my NF, here goes! My last few posts put it in perspective for anyone unsure of the situation. Thursday I was toiling with my decision to leave them. I put my two weeks in last Monday. After seeing those texts I was so glad that I did. Come to find out, NPs put 22moF in daycare. Not only daycare, but the same one I worked at and where I met NF. Obviously when my old coworker saw that my old NK was going to be in her class, she asked me what was going on. So although I gave them two full weeks, they were going to let me go Friday. Then NKs are starting Monday. NPs didn’t tell me this...I had to overhear. Here’s the kicker....on the day I decided would be my last day (Thursday), MB texts me and says that they’re “still struggling to find care and they’ll keep me updated.” 🙄 Her “plan” was to just try to keep me around by making me feel guilty that they don’t have care. They straight up lied to me and that information along with everything else that had happened was enough to confirm that I was leaving that day. After a year and a half, neither parent has ever complained to me about what I’ve been doing. They thanked me for being flexible, for doing all I did for their kids, and just generally being who I am. Thursday happens to be when DB began nitpicking about me not updating the tracking app frequently enough, hinting that I left 22moF in a diaper for 3.5 hours. First of all, that has never and would never happen. How convenient that they had things to complain about suddenly now that I was to be no longer working for them. The hardest part all day was keeping my cool and having to act like everything was okay because they still hadn’t told the girls. 22moF would have known but really had no idea, of course. 5F was who I was concerned about. I was on the verge of tears all day because she had no idea what was going on and was telling me about everything she wanted us to do over the summer. Knowing I had to break the news to her that afternoon was breaking me. But I made it the best day possible. After nap, and right before I was going to leave, I had to take it upon myself to let her know what was happening. I made her a heart shaped card and wrote a note to her and attached her favorite candy to it. I went upstairs and read it to her, gave her a big hug and told her that nanny has to go to school to become a teacher and I won’t be able to be with her every day anymore. I told her that I love her so much and if it’s OK with mom and dad, she can call me anytime or have me come visit. She was sad and then asked if another nanny was coming. I told her no and that she would have so much fun over the summer, then go to kindergarten in September. She gave me a hug, kiss and said “love you”. 22moF was still sleeping but before nap I gave her a huge hug before putting her down and told her I love her so much. DB came up minutes later to relieve me. He mumbled a “thank you” for taking 5F to school that morning since they had failed to communicate with me and I took it upon myself to drop her off. He said something along the lines of “I may need you to do that again tomorrow.” I simply nodded and waited until he went back downstairs to place the letter along with my keys, library card, etc. on the counter. I walked out and got in my car. MB was on the phone in her car in the driveway, so I had no communication with her. As I drove down the street knowing that would be my last time, it all came out. I called my mom and sobbed. More because of the girls who I’ve grown to love so much. My parents have been by my side since this whole situation started and they talked me through it. I am still in shock that I was so betrayed and disrespected but I’m glad that the situation is over and I am now in a better place. I have not gotten any feedback from old NPs and that’s fine with me. They know what they did to me is wrong. I said everything that I needed to and nothing else needs to happen from here, unless they reach out for 5F. I actually started my new position today! NPs are great and MB is here working me through my first day. 1M is the sweetest along with their super cute dog. No red flags so far, both NPs seem super easygoing. Their house is clean (finally), and they just generally seem like nice people. I’m so excited and I feel like I will actually be able to enjoy nannying now. Thank you all so much for your suggestions, feedback and well wishes!
