from what i understand the orthodox church teaches that some people will accept god and some wont and therefore will suffer for eternity because they reject gods love and it burns them, some people die without having a chance to choose, i dont understand how it all works and thats why i am here making this post, can someone change or are those who will choose God already guaranteed to do so, is it black and white, your soul either will accept or reject god and theres nothing that will make you change and repent? do those who die from starvation and die as babies and little kids have good souls that accept Gods love ? if it s black and white like that it means that not everyone can be saved and means that someone with a bad soul panicking about their eternity is of no use, if some die that could be saved but dont get saved that means that God could save them but he lets them suffer for eternity because "thats just how things are", my point is either its black and white, where people either have good or bad souls and that cant be changed no matter what, and those with bad souls will suffer for eternity, or its grey, where everyone can be saved, if thats the case then that either means God lets some perish that could be saved or that universal salvation is real, if one believes that everyone can be saved but some get saved while others dont the that means they believe in luck, if those who die as babies and die from starvation go to heaven that either means they would have choosen God and be saved anyway or that they just got lucky, i just dont know how all of this works, sorry if my post doesnt make sense, if God can save everyone but he chooses to let some perish that either means he chooses to do that or that he doesnt have the power to save those "unlucky souls". it means that God is helpless in this situation, some get lucky and get saved, others who could have been saved are not so lucky and will perish, in that case as i said, either God has power to save them but chooses not to or hes helpless in this. May God have mercy on us all if he is real.
