Quick backstory: I’ve been exclusively dating my best friend since last august, before we were just fwb. A couple months before august she quit her job that was supporting her due to personal issues and I completely understood because it was a toxic place but ever since then she’s been struggling with her bills and has to have a 2nd job to pay all her bills. I got a new job that takes a lot of my time and we started to drift apart, she Stopped being affectionate and was focusing mostly on her and again as her bestfriend before I support this do you and what you need to do in order to have good mental health and stability. But at the same time if only 1 person is putting in the effort and the other isn’t it’s an imbalance of energy put into the relationship and After I spoke with her and finally broke down and told her how I felt she responded with “well I This” and “I that” and completely ignored what I was sharing. I ended it. The next week she says she needs to talk to me ASAP, so I go see her after work she is nervous and pulls out a pregnancy test and it’s positive. We went to her doctor to confirm it. Now she needed time and came back to me and decided that she wasn’t ready for a baby and wanted to end the pregnancy using the chemical medication you take from planned parenthood. It’s now been a week since then, going on 3 weeks since the initial conversation. And I don’t know how to tell her that I don’t feel anything anymore, I’m clocked out and she’s continuing to try to put in her effort which feels suuuuuper late and it’s not that I don’t appreciate it but I already decided that this isn’t what I want anymore. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to say it especially after everything that just happened. I feel really guilty but I feel even guiltier when I’m with her and don’t feel anything. But feel the most guilty when I do leave I feel like an asshole because she decided not to keep the baby. Please help; this is eating my mental health every day
