So I (22 years old) met my “bf” through Bumble a month before the coronavirus got out of hand in the US and Europe. I met him through bumble while on vacation in Barcelona. I live and study in London as a student. We met up for a date and ended up spending everyday of the rest of the holiday together and I went back to London and we would talk all the time. He ended up asking me to be his gf after only a week and I ended up flying out to see him every weekend. We also hit important milestones like saying I love you after one week and meeting the parents after only a month. I realized it was fast but both of us really only had one relationship before and we’re kind of two socially awkward people who never get asked out on dates. Long story short, we made all these plans to go on a trip together after I was going to visit my parents in LA for 2 weeks. When I went back to the US, shit hit the fan with the coronavirus which led to him and I both going into lockdowns in California and Spain and not being able to see eachother and now we don’t know when I’ll be able to go back to Europe. Ever since getting back to the US, he started taking longer to respond and the other day he sent a text saying he loves me a lot and I’m a special girl in his life but we went really fast in the beginning and he wants to take this time that we’re not together to take it a bit more calmly and slow and get to know eachother better before getting into a serious relationship. It made me a bit sad not going to lie but I can see where he’s coming from. I don’t even know what we are to eachother because he still calls me baby and texts me good morning. I think he wants to just be in that “talking stage” before we go into a serious relationship. Is this anything to worry a lot about? Or Is it just because of the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of his lockdown?
