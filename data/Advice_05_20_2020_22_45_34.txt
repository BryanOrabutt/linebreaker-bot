So before I begin I should probably mention that I went through something pretty traumatic. My mom threatened to kill me, I won't get into the details but she's working through it. After that, or maybe it was even before that, I started to get really paranoid. And at first I thought it was just anxiety, so I took an online test. It said I had mild anxiety but when I read what anxiety really is, I knew it was more than that. Im not denying I have some sort of anxiety, but I'm not afraid of what's going to happen. I'm only afraid of what is happening. Once I was making burritos and uses a knife to cut the burrito. For some reason it scared me holding the knife, and when I put it into the sink, I couldn't stop staring at it. I was scared of it. I was scared that it was going to hurt me. I started rushing and putting salsa on them and when I threw it away I spilled some. So when I was cleaning it up I had to look away from the knife. Which terrified me, so as soon as I was done cleaning it up, which I did as quickly as possible, I spun around to look at the knife again. And then I took my burritos and ran to the couch. For a while I just sat there, scared. There are more situations like these including one where I was singing an Adele song and looked ik the mirror and saw a wreath, for some reason it really freaked me out, because I thought I saw a person, or some creature. Right when is aw it I stopped singing and just stood there, really scared, watching it. I knew it was a wreath, but it still scared me. Whenever I glance at it I still get really freaked out. I know I probably didn't have to say all this but I'm still scared. And now when I'm sleeping I wait up sweating a little, which never happened before. And I have a huge fan next to me so it's not because of the temperature. I know I should probably talk to my counseler, but I'm just afraid I'm overreacting. It would be nice to have a second opinion.
