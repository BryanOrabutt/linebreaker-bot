Okay so where to began...Alright so in one of my classes theirs this girl letâ€™s call her Rachel. (Background) So Iâ€™ve talked to Rachel and i never though to much about it but one day like a month and a half ago my friend suggested to me that maybe she is into me and after that i started paying attention and I realized oh shoot maybe she is. So afterwards I started noticing she looks at me but she doesnâ€™t break eye contacts which is kinda weird for me lol but besides that let me get to the real stuff. So every now and then sheâ€™ll pretend to not know my name or purposely mix it up with my friend then afterwards pretend to be confused then sheâ€™ll be like oh then give me a smirk and another thing is that she bumped into me and gave me a playful elbow Iâ€™d you know what I mean, another thing is that sheâ€™ll make up things I never said (an example is onetime my friends told her how I might join track and I was like yah Iâ€™ve been thinking about it then she told me I thought you said you didnâ€™t want to talk to me anymore. Another one is when we were talking and she was like letâ€™s try to guess each otherâ€™s birthdays and then itâ€™s time to guess Rachelâ€™s birthday and I get it and it passed like a month ago then she tells me wow (enter my name) how come you told my friend happy birthday but not me and Iâ€™m my head I was like what I didnâ€™t even know your friendðŸ˜‚. And theirs one more thing before I go so their was this one time she said I looked like I had soft skin and I was like fr and then Rachel started rubbing my forearm, the other time is when in class we were doing a project and I got up to throw some stuff away and she was walking towards me and bumped into me and while she did that she gave me a playful elbow. Thatâ€™s it for now itâ€™s pretty much 4am but please comment and give me advice on this I need it and if you want more information ask and Iâ€™ll tell you thanks yâ€™all (hope this doesnâ€™t go unnoticed or buried Iâ€™m new to reddit:) )
