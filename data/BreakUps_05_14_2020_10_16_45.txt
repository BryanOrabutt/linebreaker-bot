Well it s somethig from my past that I really nedeed to get off my chest. We fall in love even though we were best friends for one year. I(M18) just fall in love out of nowere with my bestfriend(F19).At first I really wasnt interested in her, I thought we were just friends, and she was an amazing friend. A friend that turned into what I thought would be the love of my life.  Some fuck ups there, some fuck ups here coming from both sides and it s one year since our breakup. I constantly think about her, I acted like a fucking lunatic because we still remained friends after breakup, I punched 2 dudes, and I was at a point were I thought suicide was the only option. I was feeling like I was a fucking disease. It s been 5 months since i punched the last guy( in both cases i was extremely intoxicated with alcohol at a party), 5 months since we stopped talking. Never go to a party were your ex is. I made the same mistake twice. I just couldnt get over her I was such a clingy mess. Im really tired of this cause we were seeing eachother everyday. We were in the same class, and it was such a weird switch. From literarly talking everyday to non existant. Untill the epedemy, she was one chair away from me everyday, right in my face. Now we are gona go separate ways in a real way cause we are going to collage. While in highschool at least I could see her even though it sounds weak, I just found peace seeing her. I acted like a really weak man, trough our relationship untill the end. I was extremely jelous, I thought I would get myself fixed quick, but I don t think I can. I get way to attached by the person Im in love with, in the end hurting myself and her. I cant overcome jelousy and it s especially hard in this instagram era were girls just put a photo of themselves and have 100 dicks prepared in her face. Is that easy nowadays to replace someone and I feel so hopeless. It s this feeling of never being enough that drives me fucking crazy. I feel so easy replaceble
