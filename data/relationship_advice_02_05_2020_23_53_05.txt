(22m) So I’ve been talking to this girl for about 2 years on and off I really care for her unfortunately when I first started talking to her I did something super messed up that I don’t care to elaborate on but we were able to move passed so she lives out of state and we aren’t in a real relationship due to us being so far apart but whenever I have the opportunity I make the drive to go hang out with her for a few day at a time so unfortunately my worst fear came true she got pregnant by another person during a one night stand when she told me that she possibly was pregnant it broke me I honestly didn’t want anything to do with her I felt betrayed but I pushed those feelings of betrayal to the side and told her that I would help her I sent her money for a pregnancy test and she was she lives with her parents and didn’t tell them or even the guy who got her pregnant I was the only one she told I  have a well paying job that I had a way to support her and I told her I would take care of her and be there for her and support her and her child she ended up not taking up my offer which I was okay with so a few weeks pass I after everything she’s going through she continues seeking out other guys while pregnant and I confront her about it and tell her she needs to think about her child it’s probably not my place to say anything but nobody else was telling her anything so early January she has her appointment for the ultrasound and she asked me to go so I went with no hesitation and stayed in her state for about 2 weeks we spent everyday together and I was happy and so was she that I didn’t want to leave and she didn’t want me to leave either but I had things I need to take care of back home so I had to leave as I was say goodbye to her she says “don’t cry this isn’t goodbye forever this is only goodbye for now” which made my heart melt the drive home is 24 hours and the whole way I’m just crying cuz I really care and realize I love this girl I get home but it no longer feels like home but eventually things go back to the way they were before I left holding onto the hope of being there for the delivery of the kid in a few months I find out she’s messing around again at this point I thought things were going good between us maybe it the fact that we are thousands of miles apart so I finally decided the day of that she find out the gender of the child I decided I can’t continue the day comes (which was today February 5th) i tell her how I feel long story short I told her everything I mentioned here and told her I don’t want just want to be a guy with his arms crossed waiting for a chance that I’ll probably never get I can say with full confidence I love and she is my first love and will always have a special place in my heart but I can’t keep this situation my question for everything is how do lift myself up cuz I’ve been crying nonstop and I don’t know if I handled things the right way
