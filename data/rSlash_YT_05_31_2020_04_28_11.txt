(Hi my first story on r/rslash and I a subscriber and nice video)cast my mom and dad sister me Dave Karen.As a kid I went to a daycare not really a daycare but at the time I was 5 or 6 so my mom would drop me off at the daycare but that day I brought the game it was a tech deck ( I got the tech deck as a present for good grades) so I took the tech deck to the daycare they would help you with words and numbers at the day care but their’s one kid let’s call him Dave was a kid he was like your you don’t give me that I will tell on you keep in mind most of the teachers there were ok so as the day keeps going Dave come’s to me and the conversation went like this not really but its as well I can remember. Dave: what’s that. Me: o it’s a car ( I didn’t know what a skateboard was so I said car) it’s a car Dave: ooo can I play with it me:Maybe Dave: why can’t I play with it I’m your friend (btw I and Dave were never friends) me: it’s a present and it’s special. At this point daycare was all most over so when I went to my mom and dad and sister she was like 3. I went with my mom but as you know some kids have Karen moms so of course this kid had to have one as my family was walking to the car the mom let’s call her Karen she taps my mom shoulder and said with a scoff my son tells me you stole that from my son (the daycare had a box of prices) my mom:no I bought that for my son. Karen: no My son had that same toy yesterday. Mom: really Karen: yes so the Karen goes and try’s to take the toy (I was tall for a kindergartener 4 something feet) I get behind my dad he’s tall like 6 feet and then the Karen get beat red mad and said she I gonna call the police so my mom says go ahead so she calls 30 minutes later a cop comes and ask what’s up Dave is scared but ok the Karen said that boy and their mother stole my son’s toy and then the police officer ask if we did and my mother said no so did my dad my mo likes to keep the papers of what she bought so she shows the cop the Proof that she bought that and the entitled parent turned pale and said that’s a old paper so the officer took the paper and saw it was new and told the Karen that she was lying so she had done this 2 times so she was put I cuffs and Dave’s dad had to pick Dave up Dave’s dad was a good guy he said sorry for what happened and that’s the end. I forgot to add something before the cop came she got hold of my tech deck and broke it she got hold of it because I was playing with it on the ground and she didn’t run because she had no car and she could not run the she broke and dismembered the tech deck I still have the thing if any other you what to see it sorry if this was long and just call me O.P. or dank or me.
