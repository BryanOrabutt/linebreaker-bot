Im currently trying to convince my mom that when she gets a new car in about a year, it should be a model 3. She says 40,000$ is to much, even though where i live its more like 30,000$ after the money from the goverment and the 8-9000$i would save on gas over 6 years.  Another issue for her is the "One pedal driving". She has no clue what that is and likes her 2 pedal driving on her honda crv from 2007, and i dont really know how to explain it, can someone explain it to me in the way you explain to a small child how to get dressed? The third issue is that theres not enough space in the trunks or to sit in even though its got almost the same ammount of space as our current suv, and we are only 3 people in the car at the same time. her last problem is that its "To flashy for (pretty rich neighborhood where me and my sister go to school, thats the main place it would be driven, to and from school 2 times a day). Ive shown her pictures of it and she says that "its to flashy and it says that we dont like poor people(?)". Now she has never been to a tesla store out of fear that my dad, who is fully on board with this, is going to be there sitting down with the salesguy signing the papers and she is going to be ambushed into signing them dispite me telling her that you cant even buy them in a store, you have to go online and only once the car has arrived 4-6 weeks later do you sign anything. So my question is: could someone who has had their car for about 6 month- a year give me a list of pros and cons? I know that tons of reveiws are out there, but alot of the time its just people who drove it for a week or a month and then sold it, i want a reveiw from someone who has actually driven it not looking for problems, but just as an avrage user discovering things as they go not as they read the manuel. Thanks!
