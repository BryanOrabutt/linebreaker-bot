So I recently found out my husband cheated... full blown months long affair, living in someone else’s room (he lives on base, we’re a military family and travel back and forth pretty regularly for now) everyone was told we were separated and/or divorcing... not true and to top it off It was confirmed the timeline includes when I was pregnant with his child. I take my blame as we hit a rough patch and I was bitchier then hell to him but in my defense it was hormones and major life changes happening, they don’t sit well together in my mind full of anxiety. He wasn’t given the green light to cheat and even denied the green light when I said do you just wanna do our own thing for a little bit (to ease the tension) and he said no multiple times. So I couldn’t, but he was fully aware he was. Anyways, the same day I found out ironically, my ex said he was booking a ticket to see our kids, we share 2, but wasn’t sure he’d have the money for a hotel. I told him to stay here (even if he was not bringing his girlfriend and kid) so he can do the morning stuff with the kids and give me a break honestly so I just have to focus on the baby. My husband flipped his shit when I told him and I feel like at this point he has zero right to say he can’t stay here. Plus I’m still being respectful enough to even tell him! I have no interest in my ex as he’s done me wrong in many ways, hence we’re not together anymore, but if him having a place to stay makes or breaks the visit I would like to make it happen. Plus we have the room so my ex will be on the other side of the house with his kids in the guest room. My dilemma is I still respect the sanctity of marriage until we are fully divorced, which I still haven’t decided on as it’s too soon and I don’t want to make any rash decisions, and I feel guilty if I allow him to stay knowing my cheating lying husband is against it. Thoughts?
