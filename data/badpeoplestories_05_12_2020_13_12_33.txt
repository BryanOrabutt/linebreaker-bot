Ok so some background my parents split up because of my dad alcohol addiction and unpredictable mood swings. There was a long legal battle for my mum to get custody of me and my sisters. I was the only one who wanted to see him (only it had to be supervised) my dad managed to get around my request by getting me to fully trust him again. (E.G buying me things and letting me eat things I don’t normally get to eat as my mum is strict on healthy eating habits). The story takes place when my dad took me to Italy. I only agreed because I have family in Italy and we were going to stay with them. So when we had landed we got our car and it was going to take 2 hours to drive there. It ended up taking 3 and a half hours but I’ll get into that. So the person who was at the car hire place said that we had a free upgrade. So when we got into the car it had NO GPS. And I don’t speak much Italian and neither does my dad I just kind of sat there while my dad started to rant about the whole thing. Then he made me download google maps and I did. One small problem tho I’ve never used google maps before. I was struggling with the controls and I didn’t really understand how to use it. (And still don’t) instead of helping me he just started screaming at me saying things like he wish I wasn’t born and he shouldn’t have brought me here. I just couldn’t really handle that and I started crying (I’m a-bit of a wuss). Then he made me call my aunt and he said that I couldn’t believe how incompetent his daughter was and he said we would be a little bit longer. Then my aunt got my uncle to drive to where we were and then we followed him. My dad calmed down a bit. And there are plenty of instances like this. When I went home always felt like it was my fault and I still honestly feel kind of guilty for angering him. But now I’ve completely struck of content with him because he was still threatening my mum with emails.
