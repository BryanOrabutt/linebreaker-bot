Alright this might get a but lengthy but I'll try to keep it short. So let's start back at my first ever girl crush. I was in 5th grade and I didn't know that a girl could like another girl so whenever I thought my friend was really cute and I thought I might enjoy dating her I brushed that off and ignored it. A year passes and the crush I had on her went away and now that I was in 6th grade I knew that you could like more than just the opposite gender and I still didn't think anything of it. I got a huge crush on my best friend but I didn't tell anyone. After half the school year had gone by and she came out to me as pansexual a few weeks prior and I thought I was bi I came out to her. I said it and then ran away and curled up in a ball in the middle of a field and wanted to cry. She of course came after me and said it was fine. About another month or two go by and eventually I tell her I like her and she says it's ok and I don't need to be scared. That helped a lot. I later came out to my other friend and so now I just had to tackle family. My brother and sister found out because one day I came home from school crying and because I wouldn't tell them what was wrong they walked to my friends house who lived a shout 15 minute walk away and she told them that the reason I was upset was because my friend told me she only wanted to stay friends. After that they didn't ever bother me about it but they knew. At some point or another one of my other sisters comes and moves in with us for a short time and sister one told sister two and sister two bugged me about it until she realized I wasn't comfortable with talking about it. Well a lot of family issues happen and I'm now living in the next town over with my grand parents. At this point I just got to the second half of 7th grade. While I was living with my grandparents my sister (who lived with my other three sisters) and sister two while angry blurted it out for some reason????? So now all of them knew and I didn't have to deal with them for a few more months. None of it was really brought up when I moved in until 8th grade when I got my first relationship ever and a beautiful girlfriend. After a month of us dating my new friend told sister one who got VERY excited and yelled about it. The next day my oldest sister (sister four I guess. Hmm I should have put initials to make this easier. Oh well) then asked me and who it was and I told her and since then everyone is very accepting and I've very expressive and everything is wonderful. No I never got the chance to tell my parents because my dad passed when I was three and my mom passed when the family issues happened. I think my mom knew though. Anyways I'm now in 10th grade and still with the same girl and I love her so much. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
