Sounds stupid, and very childish. But to simplify stuff, I had lots of very intense trauma as a kid and as a coping mechanism learned to be egotistical and only care for myself and only love myself as a “survival” tactic. I could always care and love for other people, but always to a limit, and that bar was set low. I have had boyfriends in the past, but it was always so easy for me to let go and I think I was just in it for the excitement of having a crush on someone and feeling as if someone was able to take care of me. Now, I’m in a relationship with a guy I’ve loved and been best friends with for three years, and no one has made me feel this comfortable. I’ve never let anyone take control over my emotions this much and it scares me so much. All of my past relationships were like little puppets to me, but now I actually care for someone. I have abandonment PTSD and have been going to therapy for a few months for it now, but had a horrible breakdown in early January. There was not a day that I did not experience flashbacks and I kind of dumped that all on my boyfriend. I would have panic attacks every day, I wouldn’t eat a thing for days at a time (and if I tried, I would vomit at times), I wouldn’t sleep for 1-3 days, I had no motivation, nothing. That went on for 4+ months, but recently I’ve felt like I’m finally getting better. I still get anxious, I don’t trust, and all of that mess, but I’m better at calming down and accepting my feelings. My boyfriend is still growing, and a bit “immature” for a lack of better terms. When he doesn’t text back for 10 hours at a time and I tell him it makes me nervous, he genuinely feels bad, tries to fix it, and just forgets. It’s a lot to elaborate on, but I’m better at handling my end of it. But it scares me that I’ve told him 4+ times, and as much as he tries, his behavior barely changed. ************************************************I’m scared of how vulnerable I’ve been in this relationship overall (being honest, sharing real feelings, not protecting myself mentally) and I’m scared for it to end because it’s one of the few things in my life that I’ve put value over myself. I’m overwhelmed with the new feelings of love that I should have learned as a child and I’m scared of how good of a person I’ve been. I’ve been more considerate, caring, and giving, and I hate every part of it because I’m scared it will go unappreciated and I’m out of control. I’m scared of being vulnerable. I’m scared he will hurt me and that I won’t ever be able to trust anyone or let myself feel this kind of love again. I’m not sure if this is normal, if I should be cautious, if I should just let myself be happy for now and if something bad happens I’ll deal with it then (I’m scared of regretting not being cautious), if I should break up with him so I don’t get hurt, blablabla. He hasn’t been the best boyfriend, but he is trying and I’m giving him a chance because I’ve never loved anyone more. I hate being out of control with my feelings. I’m scared of being hurt and I’ve started to distance myself from him a tiny bit so that I can feel as if I’m protecting myself (he does not notice my absence much so it’s not hurting our relationship). If someone with experience could give me some advice it would be of great help, because I don’t know what to expect and what is/isn’t a side effect of my trauma. As I said earlier, I’ve been in relationships before, but never one where I genuinely cared for the other person. Before it’s always been for self-gain and nothing more.
