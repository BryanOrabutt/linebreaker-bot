Take this with a pinch of salt but I moved to Calgary looking for a quieter life in a big city. Now I've visited many times and found that I really like it here and the people are really friendly and nice. I was born in Canada and I've been a firefighter in the USA for over 20 years. I lived in Detroit, Phoenix and all over. The same reasons that drove me out of Detroit are driving me out of Calgary. Property taxes are disgusting here considering the services. I mean I paid $3600 in Detroit for property taxes but I felt like I get more services there and I do here. This city literally has house prices dropping and property taxes raising at even faster rate. I bought my house for example 1 year ago 2400sqft it was listed $610k in a nice part of town. I paid $580k thought I got a great deal. I currently have it listed at $500k and no punts same for all my other neighbors with their houses for sale. Literally its been on the market 3 weeks I've had not one showing. My realtor keeps saying lower interest rates, spring market it will pick it up but will it fuck. The city assessed my house as being worth $650k I can't even sell it for $500k WTF is up with this city? my property taxes have risen to over $5k a year. This city is not worth $416 per month in taxes. The services are fucking shit in this city it is like the Canadian Detroit but Detroit has better snow clearing. Anyway we are moving back to Phoenix I can't take this shit anymore back to the place that is hotter than the sun in summer. Please don't let anyone tell you this is a great place to live its fucking heading down the toilet along with the price of a barrel of oil which has been overtaken by a CostCo big pack of toilet paper. Sure it has some nice parks and the mountains are undeniably amazing but that doesn't make up for the fact how this city is running into the ground, Fish Creek is run by the province and the mountains are themselves.
