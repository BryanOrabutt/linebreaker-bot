I got it running, made a character (better creator than swtor) and chose a planet to start on. I got dropped somewhere in Mos Eisley and had only a blaster, a speeder and some vegetable on me, basic rug clothing. I barely had any credits and went to a mission terminal near the local cantina. There I picked a mission. I went to the location and almost died fighting a womp rat. Then more rats appeared and fucked me up quit badly. I randomly get healed and notice a Twi'lek in similar clothing to me saying "I got you". We fought them off as best as we could and both died. I wake up in a hospital in Mos Eisley and the guy is standing in front of me. We are both ranting about these little bastards that killed us. He says: "dude we gotta get buffed". So I follow him and we  go to the local clinic. There are two doctors in there, two Twi'lek (quite hot btw) and we have to ask them to heal us up and buff us. Then we go to the cantina and watch Dancers and listen to musicians (who are players) to get more buffs. Then we both decide we are ready to hunt again and this time do it right. He gives me a carbine and says it's better than the shit one i got. I wanna give him money, but barely have any and he says it's a gift. Then he shows me how the combat works on some rats outside and it works out well. We do some missions, have nice conversations and after coming back home, we both had the same thought. That our speeders are shit. He orders one, but the problem is the seller (there's only player traders, no npc vendors) is in Alderaan. So he said fuck it. And decided to go to the spaceport, while I check out the town. "1000 credits for a ticket and 5000 for a speeder, fuck that" he said. At least i wanted to repay the debt by giving him credits and basically paid him 2000 credits, to compensate for the blaster. And so it went on. Damn great experience, haven't had that in a game in a long time.
