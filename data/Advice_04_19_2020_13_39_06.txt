For starters let me say that I understand that I am in control of my life but, I have things blocking me. I am a 23 year old guy and I take college courses while I work and stay with my parents. My sister and I have a seven year age gap. From the age of 8 I remember my sister running into problems with my dad when it came to boys. When my sister was 15 or 16 I remember her going to a football game at her high school and my dad went to go pick her up. When they got back home I remember him yelling with anger and tears in his eyes with his fists balled up asking "WHO IS HE WHO IS THIS MOTHER F\*\*\*\*?".  It turns out that my sister was just under a blanket cuddled with her boyfriend which I was confused as to why he would react that way. The entire night was my dad angry and yelling telling my sister that she was acting fast and that she would get pregnant. I remember my sister getting whipped and begging my dad to stop because he didn't like her boyfriend. When I was in middle school my parents would always say that I wasn't allowed to talk or text girls outside of school and any girls number that I had my mom would call or text them and tell them to leave me alone. If I was outside with my friends my mom would call me over with the phone bill and ask me if I was engaging in conversation with girls. I was caught masturbating one time to porn and my mother called me disgusting and told my dad that I should be ashamed of myself.  The only conversation that they had when it came to talking about sex was "A real man keeps it in his pants!" My mom was in school studying to become a nurse at one point and there was a section covering the male genitals. She forced me to show myself to her at 12 or 13 and I kept telling her that I didn't want to and to just use my dad. I honestly don't know what to do. I haven't engaged much with the opposite sex but I just want to know if this is normal and if i'm overreacting?
