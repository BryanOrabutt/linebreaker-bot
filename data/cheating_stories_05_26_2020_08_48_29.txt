I was with my ex with an on and off relationship with a LOT of history, the good and the bad, that came with it. After the two years... I really found my self after being away from him... almost finished with my degree and have a good job... then I started to have a little epiphany where I just missed the energy I had with him, the crackhead, adrenaline energy I hadn’t had in a long time... and I decided to see him after the two years... and I saw that he was in a place where I was not really in love with (he didn’t meet my standards)... but the history and the emotion* was there and we had really intimate sex. .. I realized he told me that he had a girlfriend where he was with, but wanted to leave... RED FLAG. Through his eyes I know him and saw he just kept his girlfriend as a keeper.... because he never liked being alone. He cheated on her and told me he never did not see her in his future ... but ... there was a part of me... that realized that she made him happy... something I know I can never fucking give him. Due to being a student and having a different lifestyle, I knew it was never going to work out. I was never was going to work out we both are two different people and have two different energies. At this point in time... I as a person only see him as someone to have sex with and party with, but nothing long term. But at the same time he’s not serious with his gf and always keeps coming back to me saying how he doesn’t see anything further: long term with his gf. We have issues where we both end up coming back to each other. We are both 20(f): 21(m)What I’m conflicted is... do I still continue to just spend time with him for the sex and good times... I feel that there is nothing long term with him and I’m toxic tbh... or do I just let him go... let him be happy with his life with his gf... tell me. Be brutal honest. I love the passion and emotional ending I have with him... but I see nothing more than just that. .. I guess we are both toxic
