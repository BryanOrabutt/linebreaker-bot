Sorry for such the long wait anyway last time we left off they just fixed up the mansion if you've been keeping up it is part 3 the spider's web I will skip the boring stuff and head straight into it after many encounters with beasts and going along the triboar trail we came across Agatha's lair talk some sense into her what I'm saying is we did all of the side quests and smaller quests nothing too interesting besides Nate does it look for a blacksmith to improve his greataxe so he looked for one and Nat 20 I made him roll again 19 so I decided what the hell how a god of forging to appear Nate said he can you improve this the god of forging okay but going to be a price Nate agrees so I rolled to see how much improved to or to see if the God that even broke his axe I get Nat 20 so I thought it would be funny to give him a 20 slashing attack instead of adding the strength modifier I will later regret this. there all the way up to the ruins of thundertree that is the interesting one so they were clearing everything out zombies spiders interact with this dude that was in the town tell them that there's a dragon young Green Dragon to be specific and in this pre written story The Dragon is initially sleeping just so the players can get an extra attack on them I assume so they go up to the place where the dragon is rumored to be then my wizard decides to hold the dragon in place which happens dragon is still asleep and Nate sneak attack critical and by this time he is a higher-level so he has extra attack you text yet again in the same turn doing major amounts of damage Dragon wakes up but cannot move and then tries to get out cannot get out inmate it's nat 20 on his next attack and then for his other attack he gets another Nat 20 there for slaughtering a young Green Dragon within two turns me being wine and I say kill the dragon everyone levels that they are the highest level their character should be right now and they should never go past level 5 they find out some information about this Castle called Cragmaw so they head over to there few sneak checks later after arriving at this Castle Nate gets into this Castle goes to door opens it finds there's goblins he brutally murdered them without the Goblins even hitting him he does this route the entire Castle all the while the wizard is staying in the back then we get to area 8 Dark Hall a treasure in this as a golden statue of a sun elf the wizard figures out at this magical item and you can ask it one question it will answer you that question so me being greedy asked where is the greatest treasure the statue replied with the greatest Treasure of 1 million Platinum points is at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean the wizard taking in this into consideration pulls out a scroll of see future and proceeds to ask every question in his mind with the see future scroll never actually using the totem and I decided to punish that character for thinking of that therefore initially breaking the game making the wizard pass out immediately on the floor with the overwhelming and knowledge and Nate sides to Camp there for the night inside this Castle next morning he is gone by that I mean the wizard Nate says oh well we are nearing the end of this all and how I broke the entirety of my campaign a little DM insight for you all when the wizard did that he had all the knowledge that God had this therefore making his mortal mind overwhelmed with knowledge that is all I can say I will I'll write next one whenever I feel like it maybe tomorrow I don't know and if you have a complaint with my grammar I am too lazy to fix it for one into this is on my phone not on a computer
