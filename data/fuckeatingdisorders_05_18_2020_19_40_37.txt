I’m going through insane mood swings. Like feeling on top of the world, loving myself, and extremely confident dancing around smiling at everything one minute. And not long after I suddenly crash and despise myself and feel like I want to disappear and harm myself and cry. Anyway right now I’m really loathing myself, and I can’t get over the weight I’ve gained. I guess I’ve been “recovering” sort of? I was purging everyday for half a year. My parents caught me and told me I had to stop. They found out in March. So since March I haven’t been purging, but I still have overeaten because I guess I put stress on my body so it freaked out?. So I’ve gained weight. I was 100 lbs and I’ve gained 20 lbs. I’m 5’4”. At this point my weight has settled at 120 lbs. But I can’t stop scrolling through photos from last year and even ones from when I was 12 and obsessing over how much smaller I was. I’m strongly wanting to lose weight, as quickly as possible. Another thing that happened was yesterday my dad told me, “ You’ve gained some weight. But like in a good way! Like you look *healthier* now. You we’re starting to get too skinny.” I know he was trying to be nice. I know. But his words stabbed through me. I wanted to cry, I clenched my hands together and felt so terrible. I already know I’ve gained weight but it’s almost like he confirmed it. Like he made it more of a reality. And my face. It’s a lot wider now. I want it to be sharp and defined again, I have a whole album of photos from when I weighted less and I want to get back to that. The temptation to be as skinny as I was is making me want to purge again. I feel so emotional like I could cry right now. I just want to spill my guts out. To feel that relief that I’m finally “empty” and cheating the system that is my body. But I know I shouldn’t I’m just feeling so confused, and mad about gaining weight I guess maybe I need advice or just someone to talk or understand idk
