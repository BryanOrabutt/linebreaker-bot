i can’t find help at the moment and if leave the app with without all my questions answered and commit any of those acts i’ll be held for culpable ignorance so i feel trapped if it’s not about my own actions it’s about being forced to admonish and worry about everyone around me and it’s really taking a toll no one will want to be around me anymore because i’m forced to tell them off when they do something gravely wrong even though it feels like everything is gravely wrong and a lot of gravely wrong things are societal norms like am i honestly expected to tell my friend if for using a condom for example or having sex before marriage when most of the time they won’t even care or even be christians. i don’t know it feels kind of redundant telling an atheist “don’t use a condom because it’s a sin” as if she’ll even care but apparent if i don’t admonish im in mortal sin so great. the fact that i’m constantly worrying whether i’m in mortal sin is already enough to affect my mental health but the fact that i’m responsible for the people around me is another foot on my neck and i’m exhausted as much as priests have told me to stay off the app and stop going on forums i can’t stop because it’s a sin in itself to commit an act in doubt of whether it’s sinful and i’ve tried to delete the app but then my mind becomes flooded with question i can’t find a solid priest so i get different answers 24/7 and different priests contradict each other. i’m worried if i find a secular mental health professional they won’t understand what i’m going through but i can’t find many catholic ones which i can afford. i don’t know, this was just a bunch of rambling but i needed to get my thoughts out there i don’t want to be nor can i handle being responsible for the people around me and having to tell them off 24/7 when all it will do is deter them from the Faith and i’ll just look annoying but if i don’t i’m committing mortal sin while i have all this personal baggage i have to come to terms with it’s seriously frustrating and annoying and i just want time to stop i don’t know how anyone does all of this maybe i should become a recluse when i’m older.
