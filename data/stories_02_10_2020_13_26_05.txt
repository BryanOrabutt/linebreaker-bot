No, I'm not joking. It's almost been about 3 years now and I still tell this story to anyone I meet to give an example of how bad my luck is (I call it lighting luck because it's a 1 in a million chance but you never want to be struck by it). I was in high school at the time and was driving around in a car with some friends late at night, as we pull up to a red light we see a mini-van **FULL** of girls our age driving around as well. They pull up behind us and we get their attention and start waving and talking a little, We turn on our blinker and motion for them to turn into a parking lot with us so we can keep talking. The light turns green and we pull in and do a quick 180 so the cars can line up side by side, we see there mini-van pull in as well and we all start cheering as many of us haven't had any game before. As their car drives by we start waving and roll down our windows to talk, and for no logical reason whatsoever one of my friends gets the bright idea to pull an r/teenagers and yell at their car "Minecraft" in some attempt to be funny. Their car speeds off and pulls further into the parking lot and parks, we do the same and start to get out. Unfortunately what we didn't realize at the time was that the wonderful mini-van full of girls did not, in fact, pull into the parking lot, but **ANOTHER** mini-van, same color (Different model but hey, it was dark and we were desperate) pulled into the parking lot, We did not expect to see 6 seniors from our school (found this out later when we saw their car again in our school parking lot) jump out, phones recording yelling "YOU YOU TRYING TO START A FIGHT?! THE FUCK WERE YOU YELLIN BACK THERE". To this lovely surprise, we quickly tried deescalating the situation by saying we thought they were our other group of friends and quickly sped off, The only thing that was actually yelled at the car when driving by was "Minecraft" so we knew right away what was said that started the whole situation, as we drove away in silence and ashamed the only thing that could say about the situation by the end of the night was, "I guess they prefer Roblox"
