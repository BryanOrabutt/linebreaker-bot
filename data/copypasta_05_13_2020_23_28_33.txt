Do excuse me for my unpleasant interruption of the current conversation at hand, but do be assured that my interjection within your exchange is of utmost importance, and that the subject that I need to discuss is worth the short period of time that I request of you to grant me to explain my position. For you see, upon further consideration into some of the topics that you have previously mentioned at an earlier point in time, I am able to discern a connection between the topic you had mentioned and a certain unnamed event that had been previously depicted in the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which has currently been running for 8 seperate parts, created by Japanese mangaka Hirohiko Araki and first published in 1987, with an anime adaptation of the series being created in 2012 by David Productions which has so far depicted the events of the first 5 parts of the series, as well as a spin off series surrounding a side character of part 4, the story of which follows numerous descendants of the Joestar bloodline throughout various time periods each carrying out their heroic exploits in the supernatural and outlandish world they live in (hence meriting the label of a "Bizarre Adventure"), from the noble Jonathan Joestar, the gentlemanly heir to the Joestar fortune, who would employ the use of an ancient martial art known as Hamon to combat his human-turned-vampire nemesis and adopted brother Dio Brando, to his more mischievous grandson Joseph, who would once again use the same powers of Hamon to combat an ancient Aztec race known as the Pillar Men, who were seeking to become perfect life forms, as well as other characters such as Jotaro Kujo, the first in a long line of joestars that would employ the use of a unique power system known as Stands, physical manifestations of the users soul capable of superhuman feats of strength and featuring creative and innovative abilities. Therein lies the issue that I wish to address, as I believe the topic you had brought up at that point in time is similar to, and likely a reference to an event within the series, but I am unable to discern if this is purely by coincidence, or rather a deliberate attempt to reference the series as an act of comedy through referential humor. Would you be so kind as to clarify this for me?
