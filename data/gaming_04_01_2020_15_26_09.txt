 Hello guys,as a serious sam fan(that videogame series,hope it gets more attention)  i want to tell you before that I finished both serious sam the first encounter and the second encounter classics,and the HD remakes,i almost finished 2 but I will soon play 3.My opinion is  that this game is a very good game,not "garbage" or "shit money-grab"  that people say. My opinion is that this game is actually great and  actually competes with all ss games.Look,I get it,The first encounter  and the second encounter(especially the HD remakes) are amazing,the best  serious sam games,those were my childhood.And Serious Sam 3 is awesome  too due to the good graphics,improved gameplay,more  campaigns,secrets,etc. but everyone seems to hate Serious Sam 2 for  being too cheesy or too funny.Meanwhile,people would complain the first  encounter and 2th encounter are too serious or the jokes are not  funny.pretty  hypocrite.Cro-team wanted to try something new,and it  worked.Look,here is the thing,the sky is blue,grass is green,you cant  change that.If croteam tried to do a serious  game,half of the community  would be upset it did not have many jokes.If it was the opposite,the  other half would think it is too cheesy or funny.But if you try to do a  mix,and have little of both in one game,both sides will be unhappy.I  loved serious sam 2 dialogue,how Sam Stone now gets much more character  development,the colorful graphics,the good jokes,and the enemies(the fat  ones that attacked Simba City).The Gun play was even better in some  aspects than the first encounter in my opinion,mainly because the guns  felt easier to use.Yea it was very cheesy but it was extremely funny and  enjoyable,and it really seems like croteam really tried to make a good  game(and it did,my opinion).Such a shame it gets too much hate,people  focus on the negative side but never try to see the positive side(I am  saying that as a pessimist).For a 2005 game,serious sam 2 had god-like  graphics,and the serious engine(also used for the other games) was the  best,ahead of its time.Even better than source,it actually took a lot of  time and effort for other engines to truly defeat serious  engine.Also,after all,I love Serious Sam 2 not for the  graphics,dialogue,or enemies,mainly for the fact that it tried something  different and that I appreciate. No other popular franchise in that  time like call of duty,grand theft auto,etc. had the balls to make a change like serious sam  franchise did. It is an unique game,and that is why,in my opinion,serious sam 2 is  an underrated fps.I do not know how many users in this subreddit know  about serious sam,because doom,halo,duke nukem,etc. are much more  popular but I really hope serious sam gets more attention due to the fact that it is one of the most underrated,and best fps series ever,and because this post is not  meant to create an argument between the fans of serious sam(those who  dislike ss2 and those who don't) I respect others opinion,i understand  why people might not like it,i just hope serious sam franchise would get more love from Gamers and i am saying that as a guy who loves doom and halo.please do not hate on me,this is my opinion.
