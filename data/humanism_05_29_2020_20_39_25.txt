After making us from the homo erectus creatures of earth and their own genes, the annunaki saw us a little better than animals but were really proud of us 'and he was pleased' in the Bible referencing Yawheh/Allah also Enlil the Lord overseer. We served them naked and we didn't even realize that we were naked because they had not bestowed upon the humans the gift of reason yet because humans were just tools for work and Enki being a senior member of the expedition of course had humans of him own but his genius made him want more for this creature than it had and so he approaches Enlil and makes the suggestion to upgrade the humans but Enlil says no and asks him to leave the humans as they are but Enki/Satan and some of his comrades go ahead to 'upgrade' some human females(he must have had plenty of human females considering he ran the 'CREATION PROJECT' at least the technical bit while Enlil/Yaweh/Allah represented the expedition and thus was credited with making us but probably some genius annunaki did it) allowing them reason and when the women gained reason of course after a while they sought to improve the rest of their mindless counterparts (think Maeve Westworld, I think she represents the Eve) and so probably Enki/Satan sent them to their camps in Eden to get some male considering they themselves knew which ones to pick and Enki 'upgraded' them and Enlil found out and made a declaration that all humans be upgraded but since now they had the sense to reason just like them(annunaki) then they would go fend for themselves and they were allowed the ability to procreate hence the curse on the woman in the Bible and Enki/Satan was banished thrown down from heaven (their space ships)..now here is my crazy thought..Enki was banished and fell to earth and of course earthlings witnessed the spectacle and out of the fear of Enlil all humans learnt to hate Enki/Satan and when the annunaki left they left Enki here as punishment forced to hide and hunted down together with his comrades 'the order of the snake' by humans and later nephilim on Enlil's orders hence the phrase 'man's children shall strike the snakes head' to spite Enki/Satan and punish him through that which he helped mankind get. But Enki is here or was here for a very long time and his order of the snake(I am saying order of the snake because him and his acolytes usually are represented by the snake). But Enlil/God or Yawheh/The Council played a secret joke on us and told us they are God and went across the globe first spreading the myths of the pantheons from Africa, Europe, Americas and Asia to prevent us from truly evolving spiritually like them, it would be like if we upgraded apes on another planet and allowed them all our jobs and secrets. But Enki has offered us hints from the shadows, the snake his representation is one of the most important spiritual symbols, Enki is enlightment and he knew that it would take millennia for the whole world to evolve but now that we are here it's a step forward. Enki is our hero
