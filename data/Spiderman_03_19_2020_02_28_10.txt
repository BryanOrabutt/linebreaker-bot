It’s very possible that the sinister six will be appearing in the MCU’s Spider-Man 3 to face off against the wanted web-slinger after being framed for the murder of Quentin Beck, but who will be in this iconic team and how will it form? This is my theory on how this will play out in the movie. Starting with the formation, I believe that Spider-Man 3 will introduce Norman Osborne working from what was once avengers tower, now the Oscorp building, I believe that Norman will hire Kraven The Hunter to track down Spider-Man and capture/kill him for his false crime marking Kraven as our first member. After a battle with Spider-Man Kraven finds that he is unable to beat him alone leading Norman to seek out help from Adrien Tombs (the Vulture) and Matt Gargan (the Scorpion) after bailing the two out of prison Norman equips them with new and improved suits and weaponry designed by Norman’s new employee the Tinkerer, Tombs may be reluctant to help at first but the villains could threaten his daughter forcing him into submission, with this we have 3 members of the six. Still believing that his team will need help Norman sends Adrien to seek out Dr. Micheal Morbius, a doctor turned monster who went savage recently, this will lead to the scene seen in the Morbius trailer with Adrien meeting Morbius, at the same time, Norman is approached by a member of  Quentin Beck’s team who introduces Norman to a severely injured Quentin Beck (Of corse he’s not dead) who is in critical condition, Norman offers Quentin help in exchange for joining his team, giving us five out of six. For the final member I have two theories, the first and less exciting one is that Norman seeks out Homecomings Shocker to join the team as the final member, and the second and more exciting one being that Norman joins the team himself, possibly after an encounter with Spider-Man, he may inject himself with an experimental form of the super soldier serum after experiencing an injury indirectly caused by Spider-Man giving him incredible strength and agility, along with making him insane causing Norman to have the tinkerer design a suit for him to join the team in giving us six villains. But, that’s just my crazy theory, please tell me your thoughts in the comments or share your theories, Thanks for reading.
