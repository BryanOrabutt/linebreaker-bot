I've been a sexual for as long as I can feel it. I barely have attraction. Sometimes I feel broken or feel bad for every person who has good perspective of me turns bad because of my sexuality and my outlook on life. My opinions doesn't matter but I feel out of place every time. I can't relate to anyone. A year ago.. My 6 months of doing things I don't want to do but I want to be someone else who had confident and stuff. I sent out nudes to people based on my pick. Not many guys but in the course of 6 months I was self harming to the point a guy threatened me to rape me and share my pictures. It was a mental torture I've come up with ways of suicide. Days of researching. I feel like my anxiety feeling and depression are my defaults. I can never feel or live in the present I've always feel like myself in this state that's why I want more mental torture. Now, I've seen it like this. I don't know what happiness is. I feel like it's never been there for me in a first place. People come and go yes. But mostly people just slipping by and I'm just looking through the window. I see those nudes as a payment to men. In my country there's a phrase of 'pakai jatah' it means debt and I've seen guys asking for sex to their wives as a sex debt because they are married. And my nudes is not fully as self harm I know. In my perspective sex is not on my dictionary I don't know how horniness works. I could care less about the guy use the pictures to masturbate but it's only for those people. I don't want it to be exploited. I'm a fan of pin up girls, lingerie garments delicate fabrics and burdoir just for the sake of human female body. Mine is not best but that's the closest thing I can photograph because I see myself not as physical being anymore. I don't like my body.. I've a lot going on in my mind. I have contradiction about my belief and what I'm raised as. It's a constant battle within myself. I cannot truly be myself even in my most comfortable place.
