Right now i’m with the best partner i’ve ever been with. I love him a lot and it’s the first relationship i’ve been in where we both really like each other and neither of us are abusive or show toxic behaviors. I’ve been in abusive relationships before and it’s taken a long time to get to a point where I don’t manipulate people in order to get comfort or try to prevent them from leaving me. Recently i’ve been having a really tough patch (my car that I just bought was totaled and I have no money in savings, job is tanking because of corona) and when we hung out over the weekend right after, I cried 3 separate times over something he said / did. He didn’t do anything wrong, it was just that he was sort of snarky or distant and I just couldn’t handle it. We had a talk and he said that it was getting to a point where he is associating me with stress. He said he had started to suspect I was manipulating him as well. I apologized and after we talked it out he said that he hasn’t thought of breaking up with me, he still sees a future with me and he still loves me. I was just stressing him out a lot. After the talk he was affectionate as normal and we’ve been talking normally ever since, but he seems a bit kore distant. The only thing he’s done is not replied to my “smooch!” Text with “smooch/kiss!” Which he normally does, but he’s texted me telling me he loves me. I’m just so worried he’s going to leave me now, but I can’t seek support from him because I don’t want to make it worse. My friend says that this is good because talking is important in a relationship and that it shows he’s willing to work with me and that he wants to be in a relationship with me, but now that i’m aware that there’s a problem i’m constantly worried about it. I keep trying to tell myself it’s normal to argue and have talks like that in a relationship (this is like. Our first conflict) but I guess I just need an outside opinion :(
