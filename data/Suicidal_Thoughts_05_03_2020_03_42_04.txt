Recently well this has been going on for a while I really want to die but i won’t kill myself because I guess It feels wrong to me I know that sounds weird but I’m going crazy. I feel so empty i just lay in bed all day and do nothing I think about myself and a lot of things ,i despise myself so much i have a hard time even looking at the mirror . I feel as if i have no purpose of being alive i’m not talented beautiful or smart or have any passion i’m a terrible person I’m so selfish i hate it I cry so much i’m happy for minutes then everything just comes back I can’t take it anymore how much longer do i have to be alive I don’t know what happen to me i watched videos googled and i couldn’t find anything that could help I don’t sleep early but i sleep a lot i eat and eat but then i just don’t feel eating anything . I’m lonely but i want to be alone i can’t do anything What on earth is wrong with me i’m young but i want to die as soon as possible and that’s terrible i should be trying to live my life to fullest . Every day i wish i would die wether it be i get hit by a car or sickness or anything i look at objects / weapons and just imagine ways I can just end it all or scenarios that I could just. but i don’t do anything i just lay in bed with my thoughts and phone wishing i could be somewhere else and waiting for deaths door . I really like this one series i know this will sound crazy but I really wish i could be in this series there are these two characters that i really like and i wish i could protect them you could say but it’s fictional it will never happen i don’t think anyone could give me advice i guess this was just a rant and i don’t think anyone else feels anything remotely similar . I’m sorry for the bad punctuation and typing and i must have misspelled something but this was just i’m not sure
