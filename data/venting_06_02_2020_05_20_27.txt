2020, its a year for me, of a lot of personal growth it also a lot of struggle. I found a passion for cooking and currently looking for culinary school. It was all bc I was at home with my fiance and we just cooked a ton during quarantine. I started relearning how to drive since I finally got new prescription glasses AND sunglasses. We started looking for a house to really start our careers after years of tiring, agonizing jobs that really take our full energy to even begin to get through. Nothing else pays as good for someone who hasnt gone back to college. We actually found a house we can afford and we got a tour, and applied all in the same day. Which still blows my mind. What are the odds of that happening right? But as time goes on as the world keeps turning, is any of this going to matter? Our brothers and sisters are getting executed in the streets while our major leader wants to kill everyone who is opposed to innocent killings. Im so sad by the lose of life thats been happening, innocent people dead in the streets and their murderers walk free and treated like royalty when they kill. Is it wrong for me to be ashamed of being an American? Is it wrong to be thinking about my family? I want to go out and protest and be there and stand in solidarity with everyone, but I also want to stay home with my family and spend time with them we might be getting our very first rental and we are so excited about it. We've never lived on our own before, so it feels like a big step up. But what if I get hurt? What if I dont come back to my family? Are more people going to die before things change? I dont know what's going to happen. But its scary. Its scary to see the government abandon its founding ideals. Im scared the government is gonna kill us all and it wont stop until they have their dictatorship complete. Its been on my mind all day and even after talking about it with my dad, my fiancee I still am so tense and dont know what to do
