I’m new to this reddit thing , I have been taking kratom for almost a year . I have no idea what my dose amount is I don’t weigh it out , it’s about one teaspoon about 3-5 times a day . I was not on anything prior to starting kratom actually had 3 years sober from heroin . My boyfriend started taking kratom and convince me to try it with him and I fell inlove with it (probably the addict in me, anything that makes me feel good I obsess over ) but now it’s to the point that I no longer enjoy taking it . I want to stop . It has caused me to be so unbelievably irritable. It no longer gives me energy except the first dose of the morning . I want to quit taking it but I’m beyond terrified of withdrawing 🤦🏼‍♀️ . I have two children one of them is a toddler that gets into anything and everything and I also own a cleaning business. I don’t have any days to just chill and lay in bed . I always have a million things to do . I’ve tried tapering but even when I cut just one dose out my legs drive me crazy at night and it’s very hard to sleep . A friend mentioned suboxen . I’m tempted to try it to see if it will help but I’m also worried that if I take even the smallest dose of suboxen that I will feel a high from it and then that addict inside of me will want to obsess over that 🤦🏼‍♀️ I don’t know what to do . I wish I never would of tried kratom . I was 3 years clean . I felt amazing with natural energy and I through it all away for this crap . Im also curious on your guys opinions on how long the withdrawals last ? I’ve been told that I’m on a very low dose ? One teaspoon 3-5 times a day ? Am I over thinking this ? Will I just be done with the withdrawals after like 3 days ?? Or do you think I might not even have that bad withdrawals except rls ? Some one please help point me in the right direction . I just want my life back . Kratom has changed me and not in a good way . I miss my sober happy energy 😔
