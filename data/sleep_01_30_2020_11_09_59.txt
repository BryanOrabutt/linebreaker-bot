I sleep anywhere from midnight to 1 AM as I have managed to reel back my sleep schedule to that point. However, I have run into an issue lately where I have been unconsciously turning off my alarm clock when I need to wake up for my college lectures. To elaborate, I use the "Sonic Bomb" clock because it seems to be the only thing that can wake me up besides someone physically shaking me awake, and you have to physically push the alarm setting slider to the end for it to turn off. Twice this week, including today, I have missed my general chemistry lecture. Upon checking my alarm clock, I noticed the slider was already set to off, but I do not remember ever waking up to push the slider. I called my girlfriend back home and asked if she saw/heard me set my alarm the previous night over our phone call and she said yes both times. Something along these lines has happened in the past as well where my father came to wake me for school (high school). When he shook me awake as per usual, I fully sat up, looked at him with my eyes still closed, and coherently said, "I am awake. I'll get up." This was enough to satisfy him, so he left the room to go back to bed. However, as he did, he noticed me lying back down. I usually did this for an extra 5 to 10 minutes of shut eye, which is normal for me, so he thought nothing of it. I then proceeded to sleep 2 hours past the start of classes as he sleeps in later than me on school days, and he came to check if I actually got up when he needed to for work. I have no memory of any of these events when they occured. I do not remember responding to my father, and I do not remember turning off my alarm. I did sleep was some in the past, but that stopped 5+ years prior to the time involving my father. So far, this "psudo-waking" has only happened 3 times to my knowledge. I need a fox for this as I cannot keep missing lectures otherwise I will fail this class. Any idea as to when could be causing this or even any recommendations is helpful.
