Hello, I am a vinegar player since season 4.  Veigar, in my opinion has not changed by a large margin; throughout the seasons, except with the introduction of the glacier rune.   I have analyzed the top veigars from every region and found two common traits among st all. Every top veigar player I have looked up builds  Hextech GLP -800, regardless of the keystone. Moreover, 80% take glacier rune , while the rest take electrocute.  Tank/Ap veigar seems to be also played more often, int he lower skilled vinegars of the top 20 such as abyssal mask, frozen heart items.  The highest winrates for the best veigar players is veigar botlane, as the adc.   I play vinegar differently, compared to the rest; which I am here to share some advice ( if you choose to take it).  I go aery rune and the 5% max cdr rune, which gives me a 45% max cdr at 18. Dark harvest in my opinion, is a rune that is only good in very situational games; and I have seen aery do well overall. Comet, is pure popo in my opinion; since it's not guaranteed damage and merc threads with pre-level 3 cage lets enemies escape. There are four  build paths I use: Rod Of Ages, Seraphs, Deathcap, Sorc Shoes or Ludens Sorcs Deathcap or Hourglass, Ludens, Sorcs, Deathcap. I use rod of ages and seraphs if I need a shield to block out a bursters damage, such as karthus; syndra or zoe. If things get worse; I build banshees; but I have only seen ZOE be able to force me to buy this item; simply because this champion is insane  in terms of builling disabled vinegar that is worthless pre-20 minutes.  I go ludens, deathcap sorcs when I see no threat on the enemy team and want the purest and fastest way to damage output, this is the few situations where dark harvest MAY work, but only in  1 out of 10 games; will dark harvest be a good option; where aery will be the BEST OVERALL option.    I did not mention the 4th build path, simply because this is the gray area, where you only go this build for fun, or when the game has too many high-target threats that can kill you in a second. This build is : Phase rush, every moveent speed rune  except mana band ( since , relying on movement speed on spells is really irritating for me) , so you take the other movement speed runes (river walking etc) + free boots and approaching velocity that gives 15% ms for disabled targets.  The item build path is... 1 x spellbinder ----> 1x sorcs ----> 1x deathcap----->Mejais 1x-----> 2x spellbinders. If you do everything well with a full build and full mejais stacks; you will be moving at 500 movement speed at all times, while having over 900 ap from items only.   My most enjoyable and shocking build is 3xspellbinder (4x if you can't get mejais to 10 stacks), movement speed rune build. Hello, this is my advice and view on veigar. Katarina, Fizz, Kasasdin are the strongest midlaners and I would reccomend banning Katarina every game, dodging EVERY kassadin enemy pick and just dealing with veigar; with a unhappy face.  I will link my leaguoe of legends account so you can look at my build path, runes  , matchups and any other questions which you can look up statistically. You can even watch my replays if you wonder how this all works. Lastly, I would like to say; veigar is a perma farming champion that needs 3 items to start being an impact on the game.  Your goal is to get through the first 20 mintes of the game, without dying and having the highest amount of gold, which will be usually in the form of cs. I also take tp every game since, I get buillied our and the only way I usually gank is through tp. Also you can backdoor ( end the game with a teleport to their base) sometimes with tp (1 in 15 games).  I know this post is low effort with spelling, grammar and other errors; but this is from the truest of my heart written. If you do truly would like to view vinegar in different lights; you will read this.
