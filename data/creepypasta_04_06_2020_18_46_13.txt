It was a regular night, my boyfriend was over. We decided to watch some creepypasta movies. Our favorite is SlenderMan. We decided we were tired and went to bed. Before we did,  we did it in bed. After that, we were very tired. So we went to bed. My boyfriend fell asleep quickly. I didn't. I heard a crashing noise from the living room, I saw a figure that looked like Hoodie. I told my self: It can't be maybe i'm just tired. Then I saw it. It was him... I tried running. Didn't work. He ran and jumped on top of me, the hard floor was cold. He cut his finger continously until I noticed what he was doing... He was going to draw the Marble Hornets symbol on my forehead. When he finished, nothing happened. I thought that was weird.  I heard a window getting smashed. My boyfriend asked what's going on. Right when he finished he froze. His face turned pale. He ran to get the gun. They chased after him. I thought that was a good time to get supplies and go to the attic. I will give you updates when I can. I am safe in the attic. I think my boyfriend is dead. I heard his deathly screams. A long black tentacle blasted through the attic floor. I immediately new who that was. Slender Man. Alot of the proxies were invading my house. It seems like they are invisible to everybody else accept the people in this house. I got a weird feeling. It made me feel evil and I had the urge to kill. I looked for something I could kill with. I found a baseball bat, a knife, and a gun. I felt like that was enough. Then I needed a disguise.  I found one and here are the details: black hoodie, purge mask, ripped jeans, jordans, and black gloves. I wanted to give myself a name. I wanted it to be ClockWise. So, that's what I called myself. I found an innocent women. I strangled her. I thought I could never change back. But I was wrong, look at me now, innocent, typing this story. I know it's short but I hope yall enjoyed!
