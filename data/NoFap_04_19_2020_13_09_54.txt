First post so here it goes, its actually kinda weird itâ€™s took me this long to share on here.. going to try and summarise this as best I can but itâ€™s hard to express how much this changed my life. Rewind the clocks 5 years and I was absolute crippled with anxiety and I mean the level of being unable to cross a road without my heart climbing and racing for no reason.. couldnâ€™t even look at a girl never mind speak too one. Going to the shop for food was a challenge, and the absolute worse was the constant butterflies in my stomach, I mean like 12 hours a day of it.. looking back I really shoulda went to the doctors but I was young, stupid and confused. Stuck in a dead end job and too paranoid too try anything else. So hereâ€™s the positive nowðŸ˜‚ The start of 2017 for whatever reason I found improvement pills video on nofap Iâ€™m sure you guys will be familiar. Committed to the challenge and not even exaggerating within around 8 days the constant butterflies that had been plaguing me for the better part of 3 years disappeared. Itâ€™s hard too express how that felt. Itâ€™s like having and illness for 3 years and then being cured overnight. So that was the first change, within around 2 weeks I could look people in the eye and hold a conversation without feeling like my eyes were flying about the room. Energy levels skyrocketed. All those things I loved too do when I was younger I could now suddenly do again without all the anxiety before during and after. My well being was just through the roof.. I felt like a kid again. Girls of course came, it was absolute crazy the attention I got thinking back on it. They went out their way too start a conversation with me all the time, asked my friends who I was etc said they had never seen me before(they had plenty of times). It didnâ€™t even feel like I was trying they seemed too come out of nowhere and actually enjoy my company unlike the 4 years prior when I was a paranoid mess and a strain to be around in social situations. Fast forward too now and yes Iâ€™ve relapsed a few times here and there but I came to the realisation that itâ€™s just not worth it. The instant gratification thatâ€™s so easy to obtain everywhere now a days eventually becomes a form of punishment.. Iâ€™m starting to sound like a freakin philosopher haha Iâ€™m gonna wrap this up. Iâ€™m 23 now, have had a girlfriend for 2 years and have an engineering job with a lot of opportunity, can drive etc without any anxiety and have a general joy for life again. If it wasnâ€™t for Nofap I honestly think I would still be paranoid too cross a road or even worse off now so thank you too all of you Iâ€™m forever grateful. So next time that urge hits you whilst we are all in quarantine just remember it might not be worth it.
