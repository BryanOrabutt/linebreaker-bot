Hi I'm 20(M if it matters), live in CA, and I am deaf in my left ear post brain damage in 2017, I fell 9 feet and hit pebble mixed concrete head first but didn't crack my skull on Dec. 26th, and I have been unable to hear through the heavy tinnitus in my left ear since, I still hear deep bass (concerts, etc.) but not more than as a buzz, and I can hear mine or others tapping on my head in what seems like the left side, (I realize it could be my inner ear picking it up, me feeling tapping on my head and my brain making the illusory correlation) but I don't know if it's just heavy tinnitus or lack of hearing as well. I've read and searched about possible causes, solutions and holistic things to help, with some avail towards the tinnitus, it no longer warbles or changes tone. I smoke, which may not be helping if it's factoring in, but I've just quit tobacco in the last 2 weeks. Now what has me going, is the emergency room doctors after the accident never sent me to an actual ENT, I went to physical and behavioural doctors to check I was still all there, could function, and perceiving what I did perceive correctly, but to my knowledge I haven't gone to see anyone that specializes in the field, that would check possible causes, I only know that supposedly, a cochlear implant will do me no good. I've read about mucus or discharge filling behind the ear drum and in some cases making hearing impossible and that persisting for long periods of time, (I've always felt I had like a mucus ball in my sinuses, I can at any time snort phlegm into my throat and hock a loogie), Or it could be signals in my brain that were fried by the impact, or a number of other causes. I don't know that any of these are the culprit for certain, and I'm low key rambling at this point but it just boggles my mind I had to follow up a little over 2 years later because I found out I never saw one according to my usual doctor at my most recent check up, she set me up with a referral and then COVID happened so that got nipped in the bud, but I'm going to follow up as soon as I can, does anyone have any thoughts on all this?? I'm genuinely curious if there's others that have been in a situation like mine and are able to comment on it and hopefully give me some insight
