a few years back my parents divorced because my mom came out as gay, This was of course upsetting but by the end of the year I had adapted to it and was feeling ok about it, fast forward a year later and my mom introduces me and my sister to her girlfriend, who is an amazing woman, kind, loving, treats me and my mom with the biggest respect and I love her and love living with her, (I should mention- I go between houses a week at a time, EG week at my moms then on firday go to my dads for a week). Then, around  october of 2019 my dad introduces us to his girlfriend, I was fine with it, as I was with my mom, and when she first started living with us I actually got on well with her and more importantly enjoyed her company, but now, over the past year I have been getting more and more annoyed about having to live with her, I dont hate her, nor do I hate anyone to be honest, but I just find it difficult and uncomfortable to live with her. Now for the reasons, firstly she is a BIG germaphobe, which I obviously can get past and almost have, but things like having to put all my clothes in the wash the second I get home and others are in my opinion too extra. Secondly, she is annoying in the way that I will just be sitting in my room on my laptop and she will just randomly come in and ask what im up to and ask what I want to do, when the reply is always just Im watching youtube and I want to carry on watching youtube. Things like that really get on my nerves but are just to small of a thing to complain about (Also, if your thinking she might just be doing this because of the quarantine being boring- no it has been this way since she moved in). There are many more reasons but Im just gonna skip to the worst reason I dislike her because its 3 am and im tired- And that is the fact that she makes me feel really bad about my sef and down on myself. As a teenager I am pretty self conscious and her constantly bringing me down really pisses me off- examples of this are the way she will constantly say uh oh when I am about to do a simple task like emptying the dishwasher or anything with a slight risk of something getting broken, another example is the way that she is always commenting on my diet and weight, which I know are unhealthy but I am clearly working on it and improving it. I really hope one of you have a suggestion on how I can possible resolve this or improve my situation- and before you say it no, I can not learn to ike her and I know because I have been trying the past year. Thanks so much for reading and please give me advise because I am just sick of having to live with her at this point.
