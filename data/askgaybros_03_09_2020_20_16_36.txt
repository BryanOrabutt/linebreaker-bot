Hey gay bros, this is my first post here and I just need some reassurance and guidance on if my feelings are perfectly fine I recently got out of a relationship in dec my first one and looking back I disrespected my own personal boundaries and put let my emotions lead to a heartbreak that could've been avoided, our relationship started  off Grindr which of course isn't ideal but overtime we grew to connect to each other more and settle but immediately after we was official he came to my house unannounced and thought I was with another man when I was sleep and my cousin used my car, after that he made a Grindr and Jack'd  account hoping he would find me on there which never happened and I had to hear from my friends that hes on the apps this happened not once but twice, later he believed that my best friend of 2 years wanted me which made no sense because he was in a relationship, so to ease his nerves I never hung out with my best friend alone, later we would argue when I had to  go out of town take care of my grandfather when my cousin visited me right after. He was offended by me being on PrEP before I met him and continuing to stay on it and claimed that if I love and trusted him I wouldn't need to be on PrEP when he hasn't been tested in over 3 years, overtime more and more issues developed and he would be so harmful he would wish that I cheat on him and catch an STD.  I was walking on eggshells so much and im more of an introvert that I felt reluctant to communicate because it would end up bad, im not going to say I was always right in the relationship I was not out to my family so there were things that I fixed such as PDA and communication but overall many of my friends were not fond of him and saw how much I changed for the worse when I got with him, I started drinking smoking and tried to do everything to please him without respecting my own boundaries, I even cut my hair for him and he couldn't change his hairstyle for me at all. The day we split was a very emotional day for me because he had another mans STD test panel in his phone, this man was being very disrespectful to him being in a relationship with me and  after he promised me nothing happened and hes gonna block him they end up talking again 2 weeks later. For some strange reason I kept him around when we split and we were still in a sense FWB but my feelings and his feelings started to come back for each other that we could work through what happened, I played the waiting game and saw this his nerves calmed and all his insecurities were gone but it was a trap, I poured my heart out to him about what I want moving forward in a relationship, gave him gifts and told how I want things to be just for him to leave me for a man hes only talked to for 3 weeks, right now im feeling shocked hurt and confused and hes moving on fast with that guy and already gave that guy the same shirt that I gave him how can I get this person out of my mind when they were so toxic to my emotional well being.
