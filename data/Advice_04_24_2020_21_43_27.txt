I’m writing this on a throwaway account because my girlfriend knows my personal reddit. So basically, my girlfriend has bipolar disorder. It can cause her to do a lot of impulsive things, like break up with me. And she did, a week and a half ago. She told me that she needed to be alone to focus on her mental health and she didn’t see herself dating anyone. Some background info: we maintained a very healthy and supportive relationship, and we were planning on spending the rest of our lives together. So as you can imagine, the breakup was completely unexpected, and out of the blue. It completely devastated me, but I’ve dealt with heartbreak before, so I cut complete contact and rigorously worked on bettering myself, not for her, but for me. I had completely shut her out of my mind, any thought of her i shooed away. And it worked so well, I was doing so well, and coping so well with her being gone. But then she called me a few days ago, saying she made a huge mistake and that her bipolar disorder got the best of her. She didn’t beg me to stay, she told me if I want to leave, she understands and she felt incredibly guilty and regretful. I told her that we could try again, but I would need space to open myself up to her again. I told her my boundaries, and let her know that if she did anything like this to me again, that it was over. Because those are my boundaries. Of course I still love her and want to be with her, the thing is that I feel so unsure. How could I have gone from wanting to marry this girl less than a month ago, to almost not even wanting to talk to her most days? What should I do? Should I take space to myself? Or jump back in and accustom myself to being with her again? I want to try this before completely giving up, because we have set lots of healthy boundaries, even healthier than before. I just still feel so unsure and I don’t know why. Sorry for this being such a mess and so long, I hope I made sense.
