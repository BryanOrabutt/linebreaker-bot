Hello reddit,this is my first post so listen me out.I have gone out with a girl for 3 months which had a friend who looked like she hated me from the beggining (I think because of my personality and jokes,I do have a pretty unusual humor but this was never a problem) of the school year and after I broke up with my ex(not related to the matter) I posted some pictures on my insta with some whatsapp conversations which I find funny abd she texts me saying I am gross and shit like that and than we start the conversation.It is very wierd because that was the first time I actually got to talk yo her because before that she would just comment I was just looking saying nothing and in the conversation I actually mentioned that I am sorry that she hated me but she told me it was a joke(I was confused because as I said,I never got to say something to her),and it all felt weird because I could see why she was nice but couldnt figure if she hated me or not.After I talked to her I was sure I liked her more than friends(this doesnt matter),and after 1 day my ex blows my phone up saying that how dare I post pictures of my whatsapp group which she was in but left and we argued,I think that this clarified the status betwen me and the girl that I think she hates me because a few days later I got a very stupid homework(I am in 9th grade)and I just ask on the school group who the hell made it and the girl that I like and probably hates me started sying that everithing is explained(which I could not understand) and tells me to shut up(I know this doesnt spund like much but she did it for no reason,I wasnt arguing with anybody in order to make her mad) it is all very strange and I dont know what to think,If she said that the hate was just a noke why would she jump at my neck everytime we werent chatting alone?I know that right know I am thinking with my pennis but is there a possibility that she like me or atleast be friends because right now I dont know what to think,I mean I read some things about this type a behavior in someone with a forbbiden crush (like me) but I dont know what to say I just eant an opinion.Thanks for listening
