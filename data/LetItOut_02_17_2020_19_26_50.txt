so this is a very long story starting from late august so me and this guy ima name him juice so i texted juice in august cause it is junior year of high school and he is graduating early and we used to be such good friends and i just really missed our friendship so i said wassup and we had a good conversation even though he was being super flirty which i really liked because he is very attractive plus i never dated or talked to anyone so this was all very exciting and ik he was a nice person so i was like “YESSSSSSS OMG I CANT BELIEVE OUT OF EVERYONE HES FLIRTING WITH ME “ and juice is the type of guy to not text back girls or just leave them on seen. even the cutest girls i know would just text him “hi” and he would leave them on open an i was feeling so special like “awww” and i think he probably liked me before because i know 100% i did not like him when i texted him i just wanted to be friends. so pretty much for a good week or 2 we are just flirting so much it’s crazy an then one day he asks me “oh do you like me...” and i was freaking out and i said “what do you mean?” trying to act dumb and he just repeated himself and i said “do you mean friendship or like romantically” because i am the type of person i don’t want confusion to happen like “oh i said i liked him but what if he thinks in a friendly way” so he said “romantically” and i was kinda dodging it then i said “yes” then he said he felt the same. and it was all good for the good month or so then he starting ghosting me the week of my birthday and then i just texted him “hi how are you” an then he said something like “i’m not ready for a relationship right now sm is happening in my life but in a couple of months ima hit you up again” and i said “okay i’ll be waiting” or something corny like that because he didn’t knew i knew his sister got really sick that week and he’s the second oldest after her and he has sm siblings and we are muslim and like have the same ethnicity so i know how the household runs and the oldest takes care of everyone and cleans and cooks and he also has sm stress from school and being a muslim teacher on the weekends i totally understood and didn’t like care? that he said we had to end it. i think it is because i knew it wasn’t because he didn’t like me but it was everything else and the timing wasn’t right. then his birthday is the week after mine and it’s on a friday cause homecoming the day after. so one thing about juice is that they are the jealous type like it’s not very obvious if you are their friend but i remember in the 2 weeks of us just flirting he would ask “oh do you got any guys in ur dms” and i would be like “no i don’t entertain them” then he said “good i don’t want any other guy tryna take my spot” and also he got jealous of his close friend (ima call him ice) that i am also close to driving me back to school and it’s only a 1 min ride an ice is super nice so they just offered and i didn’t think nothing of it but juice got so jealous. so back to their birthday me and ice were walking back to class and i didn’t know juice would be in the same hall and me and ice are very play fighty and me and ice knew each other since we were like 12 so we’re very comfortable with each other an then as we were play fighting juice walks into the hall and ice says “there goes the bday boy” and juice looked so MAD at us together and i just put my head down and tried my hardest not to cringe at how awkward i felt. then the next day HOCO so MUCH happened oh my god so i go to homecoming and like everything’s chill i’m with some of my friends an i see ice and their friends which i am also friends with and i was like “hi ice” and they didn’t recognize me cause i had my hair out and was wearing a cute tight dress on some harami shit and they were like “you snapped” and juice didn’t go to homecoming cause they find it “unnecessary” but all their friends were there and taking snaps and stuff so ices friend group are kinda weedheads and they took a lot of hits off a dab pen then one of the guys im friends with (ima name him candy) so candy started tweaking off the weed and could barley stand and he had his arm wrapped around my shoulder and ices friend group was like taking pics of us and mind you juice and ice and really close and so is their friend group and then ice was taking photos of me and candy of us being super close but i didn’t think they knew it was because he could barley stand so that’s why i was holding onto him and he was leaning on me. so i guess ice or one of their friends sent it to their gc with juice in it obviously and then immediately i see him typing then he removes me off snap and then the monday of i see juice and he looks so mad. and i was very confused so this is oct and i start getting over him because so much happened in october so i didn’t need another distraction then nov came and i was like “hmm i’m bored i wanna crush on juice again but with no one knowing so it can be my little thing” so i only told 2 friends and so they could tell me if he was looking at me or anything like that and he would most of the time be looking at me and i wouldn’t be able to tell cause i don’t have my glasses and this is in november a month after we ended it. so thanksgiving break comes around and i accidentally call juice because their name was next to someone else’s and it was late and i was barley looking at the name and i was like “omg sorry accidental call😭😂” like something not very serious cause i didn’t think much of it even though it was like “OMG YOU JUST ACCIDENTALLY CALLED YOUR CRUSH/PERSON THAT YOU USED TO LIKE AND THEY LIKED U BACK” but even so i was just like we haven’t talked in months no person would care if you accidentally call them for a sec with a message saying accident. but then they got so mad for some reason and was like “we’re not friends don’t call me” like 5 days later and i was so confused and also mad because it was just an accidental call which i said and i was like “why are you being rude i literally said it was an accident stop crying about it” and he said “okay and how do you accidentally call someone” and i was like “what are you talking about everyone does that all the time it’s not that serious” and then we started arguing back and forth over something so dumb. because it was no reason to argue but also i remember them saying “i’m done with this convo” and i would be like “yea cause you know you’re in the wrong” and they would come back and still reply and i would be so confused if you didn’t want to talk don’t reply !!!! so that is late Nov then we go back to school when it’s dec and everytime i saw them i would just give them mean looks (mind you i just asked my friends if my mean look is scary and they said i looked like i was about to cry) so then like the week before midterms juice calls me exposing all his feelings and was like “i know you like me back” but i was like “if you liked me why were you being so mean at me just accidentally calling you” and idk some part of me was like don’t say too much cause they were still mean to you and you don’t know how they are going to switch up. and then i was like “thanks okay bye” then i went to class. so skip time because literally nothing happened after that call so now we are into jan. and i was like “dam i should ask why they never hmu or nothin and also ask why he had such a problem with me that one time i called him on thanksgiving by ACCIDENT BTW like i was so confused why they were that MAD” and then they started going crazy on me again like they day in nov except they started accusing me of things i didn’t even do like call them off a priv number and i was like “even if i did you would recognize my voice would you not” and then they pretty much told me that their annoying cousin that is known for treating girls so bad gonna name them trash for what they are. so trash was on juice phone and was just typing for him and he was the one being all rude to me. and one day i was in a gc with trash and they kept tryna be rude to me and i dropped screenshots of me an trashes convos where they were begging me to s*ck their d*ck and trash is EIGHTEEN and i am SIXTEEN. and juice got mad at me and i was like “okay and ? aren’t you happy your cousin getting clowned by the way he be b*tching you around” and he got quiet and then at school i never see trash around btw but i always see juice so i got mad when the next week we go to school and they start giving me mean glares like i did anything to them so i have been giving them mean glares back and i know for a fact he still likes me because on some conceited shit i’m top tier my personality is really nice and i have a good body and i am on the cute side plus i know too because one day in the morning they went to go get water and i was sitting by the water an he glared at me and i glared back then i started talking to one of my guy friends that is shorter an younger than me and juice walked back and looked even more madder/jealous and this was like last thursday and this is how CONFUSING everything in my life is with juice and everyone but i don’t like juice anymore since that convo in nov i didn’t like them but the call they gave me in dec apologizing made me want to at least want to be their friend but now in feb i would rather us hate each other than ever even be mere acquaintances and this is the end of it all i wrote this all cause i needed to get this off my chest and plus i feel like i wanna look back on this when i’m like 20 something and think about how CRAZY life was when i was just 16
