It's been 2 weeks since I(22) lost my little Brother of 19 years... it still doesnt feel real. I wake up everyday waiting to see him but it just.. doesnt happen. I've been off work for the past 2 weeks because thankfully my work is understanding so they gave me 2 weeks of paid time off. The day has come where I'm supposed to go back to work but I just... cant. I'm supposed to be at work right now as my first day back but here I am 2 hours after my shift started and I cant get myself to get out of bed. My brother and I always talked about our future and how we wanted our kids to be best friends. We always smiled and laughed together and I always looked forward to him being around. He was always smiling, I rarely knew a time he was not. Even though he was younger than me I often found myself looking up to him. I'm apart of the military and he asked me so many questions about it and ended up joining so we could work together. We were both reservists so we didnt have to worry about being separated. He was visiting for a weekend at our parents house (where I was currently staying) during his tech school training and I decided to spend the night at my cousin's since I havnt seen him in awhile either.. my brother, that night, passed in his sleep. I dont feel comfortable talking about how. I cant help but feel responsible, like If i didnt go to my cousins, i could have been there and my brother would still be alive. Lately I've been struggling over what i believe and have been losing sleep and just cant find myself going back to work yet. Like life is at a standstill. I cant get his oxygen deprived look out of my face when I saw him. I just see it nonstop. I need help, I dont know what to do. How to you cope with losing your brother.. how do I get myself to go to work so I can pay my bills. How do I keep life from feeling like a standstill so I can live my life and take my brother on the journey he didnt have the chance to take...
