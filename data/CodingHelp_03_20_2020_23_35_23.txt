Hello!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So I'm looking for something really simple and unique, kind of like a script, so what you have is :                            0000000000  a character can take two forms, 0 and 1 so basically you have 144 total combinations, could you mind to show me a script that can make up every possible combination out of those characters with the two forms (0 and 1) they could take?                                                                                                                                                                                Thanks!
