So an old friend got back in touch with me, I think it was maybe over a year since we last spoke. He started to ignore my messages randomly, then we would plan days to meet and I would book time off work or skip out on overtime to meet him, but he would always make an excuse as to why he didn't message, this went on for about 3-4 months, I think I booked 6 days off in that time and skipped out on atleast 100 hours of overtime, even when I need the money. Eventually I started getting sick of it as I found out from his partner she was 12 weeks pregnant and the reason he wasn't meeting me was he was up on fortnite all night and wouldn't wake up until 5-6pm, he's 23 years old, 2 years younger than me, so when I eventually met him (I had to go to his at 9pm) I just told him straight, I don't want to go into much detail but what I said was right, everything he was doing wrong and letting me down and plenty of others, I don't have many friends because I'm pretty socially awkward, the friends I have now are friends from 10+ years ago. Well my grandma passed away 6 months ago last Sunday and during that period I never got a message from him, my grandma was like my mum to me, my parents moved away to Spain when I was 20, I don't have any other family that live in the area except my grandma and my grandad, she was everything to me and all my friend knew that, I still had him on Facebook and he still had my number but not one message... it really did hurt tbf and I was suffering really bad with the loss of my grandma, I lost my job through missing shifts, (I couldn't pull myself out of bed) very awful depression for 4 months. Sorry with the long back story but I really need the advice, he messaged me last night asking about my daughters and partner, but nothing about sorry for not being there at my lowest?? I just don't know what to do, I do miss him but how can I ever rely on him as a bestfriend again? When his dad died I sat with him for hours and just held him tight, was like my brother and I felt his pain in that time aswell but nothing from him, I'm just really at a loss because I have no friends really anymore.
