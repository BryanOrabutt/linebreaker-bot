Okay so my poor fiance had his appendix burst over Thanksgiving then he went to the Urgent Care which at this point we did not know that his appendix had burst the Urgent Care gave him some antibiotics and sent him home saying he had a stomach bug fast forward about a week later we take him into the local hospital they drag their ass and decide to put a tube in for a drain that they then leave in for over a month and it Formed an infection so same surgical team takes the appendix about a week ago,(Mind you this started on thanksgiving!!!) and misses and appendicolith so week after the surgery he's having horrible abdominal pain on the opposite side from the surgery so emergency room again this time they say he has a small abscess around the appendolith and a blockage in his intestines so they give him some antibiotics and set him up to see his doctor in a few days his Hospital appointed doctor mind you who did the surgeries and so far has screwed things up so let's get this finished. we go to see his doctor dr. Does some scans he say I quote 'that little tiny thing will keep you on antibiotics and it'll pass on it's own' fast forward a few days further no bowel blockage in the emergency room again to find out that the abscess has doubled in size from the appendolith he said did not need to be removed now they want to put another drain in him and are refusing to release him or transfer him to another hospital because he doesn't want to see the only surgeon that they have on team which is the appointed doctor he has that has screwed up and because he's on Medicaid he cannot legally check himself out against medical advice without paying his own bill are they legally allowed to Stonewall him like this into staying when he's not a medical risk they literally observed him last night and gave him IV fluids and antibiotics and now might be able to get the surgery done today he wants to leave and go to a different hospital can somebody just give me advice on what to do the insurance company will not authorize a transfer unless it's medically necessary but I really don't want them to screw this up anymore I'm so scared that this time they're going to perforate his bowels or do something horrible this time please any advice would be nice
