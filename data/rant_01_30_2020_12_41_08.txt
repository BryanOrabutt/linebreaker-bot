I'm a grad student at a state university and I need a flexible job for school, hence the reason I chose substitute teaching. Unfortunately, even though I have been working with a certain school district since March of 2018 I have not been offered any health benefits (reason being is that you must **accumulate** **600 hours** **EVERY SINGLE** school year in order to be **OFFERED** health insurance **FOR THE** **FOLLOWING** school year). One thing to note about this line of work is that substitute teachers are on standby from 5:30am to 8:30am, so if they receive a phone call to work, they can then either accept the job for that day or don't. And it's for six hours of paid time, even though you might be at the sight for eight hours. The reason I am writing this post is that the previous jobs I've held in the past have offered at least this much after a three month period after starting said jobs. I'm starting to become jaded that some schools and their school district (administrators) don't give a shit about the educators they employ, because at the end of the day substitute teachers must fight tooth and nail for a limited number of jobs that they are not entitled to. I have been fortunate enough that schools and teachers will often call me back to sub for them, but it has taken a lot out of me just to be able to be qualified for this coming august. Until then, I will be paying my state's mandated health plan out of pocket, which is already hard enough on top of the looming student debt I will eventually have to pay back in full, in conjunction with the rising costs of living in a city that I was born and raised in. Also, one last thing I wanted to mention is that there are only 180 days in a given school year, and most substitute teachers will not be called in for those 180 days. Substitute teaching is a hard job and it's even harder when you hear everyone talk about how important educators are, even though substitute teachers more often than naught receive the short-end of the stick when it comes to being educator.
