Last week I had a pretty good and fun conversation with my crush after I left school I was so pumped up like you know it felt good that I had the balls to talk to her and it turned out to be really good. So I tell myself that next week I'll try and use what we discussed before and use them to start a new conversation to you know have a gameplan that I can follow if I fuck up right. So next week comes I'm bout to see her Im pumped then my friend and meet(same age as me)and we start to talk then states eh I dont think my Crush likes me then I asked him did you tell her, he states no....and im like phew, then after that hes like he said SOoo. you(Referring to the crush)......and me(referring to me, like aww yall look cute together)and at that point im so triggered and instantly get so nervous and shit and throughout the class period I keep looking at her but don't got the balls to walk up and talk to her and throughout this whole time she making that awkward Ik you like me eye contact [right. So](https://right.So) Next day I tell myself to fuck it use everything Ik go talk to her be confident, use the conversations I planned in my head from last time, go and flirt and even if she does know I like her I can kinda impress her a bit without really committing, and of course, I chicked out, but this time its kinda different the looks she gives me don't really look like the Ik you have a crush on me look, its looks like the I'm waiting for you look but I'm still unsure about us [look. ](https://look.So)[So](https://look.So) after that day... Im pretty torn down I think bout giving up and moving on but Im already to invested and I think if we do just stay friends its just gonna lead to me liking her again so I might as well try again, take my chance and if I get friend-zoned well at least I tried and learnt [something. ](https://something.So)[So](https://something.So) day 3, final day I have a master plan I not to confident but it way better than the previous days and she is still giving me that well talk to me look right, I want to approach her but she is with her gang of girls you know and i decide to wait after their done talking I try to approach her and I instantly turn around and I start doing another random activity to avoid talking to her.
