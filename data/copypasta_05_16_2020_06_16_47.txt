 Once upon a terribly dreadful time, there was a small cat-licking bird  that lived on a not-so-big lane by my house whose name was Charles just  like every other soul, male or female, that lived on my smelly, stinky,  orange, old, rotten, messy, busted cul-de-sac between Belmont and Rose  which are both Gay-ass Streets Like North street or some shit that  reminds me of a celebrity like Paris Hilton or some blonde loser that  doesn't even know the capital of her own country, which is the United  States of America aka: The U.S.A which is a pristine nation of beauty,  opposing to a country as the country of Somalia and Belgium, a part of  Europe, which doesn't even have a government, it's just in a complete  state of anarchy just like my mind and soul which are both filled with  outrageous nonsense that I'm typing down right now into some fat long  sentence that probably makes no sense but who cares I'm trying to set  some sort of weird record here like most ducks snorted or some weird  thing like that and if I do set some sort of record I will be in the  Guinness Book of World Records (though anti-American and pro-European, a  place of pitty and despair as Somalia is) which was always my dream  because that book has a whole bunch a cool and weird stuff in it and I  would Become famous and add to the weirdness of the book like some of  their records which reminds me of the Rob & Big where Rob sets all  of those skateboarding Records And Big Black eats bananas and donuts and  three weeks later they both get plaques saying the record they set and I  want to get one of those so that's why I'm writing all of this stuff  down without ever using a period or some other sentence ending mark like  an exclamation point or a question mark or any other symbol that could  possibly end my streak of words that is really long now and would take  me a while to count just like counting sheep which is supposed to put  you to sleep but it really keeps you awake because you want to keep  counting and counting until you don't know what comes after trillions,  but that would take Years or something because it would take a while  just to count a trillion seconds or minutes would be even worse just  like how ducks are worse that geese because they are more aggressive  around their young unlike great white sharks which are often eaten by  their mothers when they are born and the ones who do make it out alive  have no mother to teach them how to hunt or whatever because none of  that matters because us human beings have mothers unless they die or run  off with some CEO of a big company or someone else who makes a lot of  money and then they leave you with your dad and you are jealous of your  friends if you have any because they have moms and you don't because  your mom was some greedy pig who wanted money but ended up only getting  the money part and she bought drugs because she was depressed and ended  up killing herself from an overdose and you wouldn't even know about it  until you become some rich person and check the files somewhere and  learn that she died of a overdose and you eyes get all teary and then  you start crying because you know that you wouldn't be alive without  that woman you called mom and I just found out right now that the  longest sentence is like 10,000 words so I have a ways to go and you  have to go with me so let's go to 6th gear and throw out some words like  Emphysema which I had to do a report on in 4th grade because we had a  ton of projects and this was the disease one and we chose diseases out  of a hat and I came out with Emphysema which is a form of lung cancer  which is 98% caused by smoking which reminds me of the way my dad  describes smoking: "you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it  on fire and suck on it" which is normally a sentence but not today  because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence that I'm typing  up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he  was "your age" about how they covered the letters on the type writers  and they had to type so that they could memorize where the letters are  on a type writer and my grandpa says he will never regret taking that  class because it helped him out a lot when it came to typing and now a  days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost as fast as me  because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't taking  very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at the pace I'm going  right now so there are going to be some serious records getting busted  when I'm finally finished writing this article on this dumb website  which will probably end up huffing this article even though it is  fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that  excuse to mom saying "just one more sentence" but that sentence is  10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace and it  is going to shatter most of those long sentence records just like how  the chargers are going to shatter the most consecutive years without a  super bowl win record and I doubt that they will win one in the near  future but they patriots are going to win some serious super bowls  because they are the best team ever even better than the cowboys or  49ers and no one cares a bout them so go patriots and boo chargers even  though I live in San Diego and Like the Padres I hate the Chargers  because they are bad and the padres are bad too but I don't care because  they are my favorite team and the dodgers are my least favorite along  with the Yankees because the Yankees get a lot of money to spend and the  padres and marlins get almost nothing and then the Yankees buy a-rod  for a lot and the Rays get almost no money but are still fighting for  first place this season without expensive players like Derek jeter or  a-rod or johnny damon or whoever because they are an all around better  team that can beat the Yankees even though the Yankees can beat the  royals a lot who really suck because they suck more that the padres do  and so do the mariners and Rockies even thought the Rockies went to the  world series last year they lost and haven't stopped losing for a while  now, either and they are last place in the nl west and that is where the  padres used to be but they started hitting homeruns and winning games  and are dong pretty good right now despite having little offense except  for Adrian Gonzalez who is leading the NL in RBI's even though he is on  the team who scores the least runs in the league but they are not last  in homeruns though they are like 5 away or something but I’m not sure so  screw that and let's talk about something fun like water or food or  dirt or something but I think food is the best because their is a lot of  things to talk about with food like you r favorite food which mine  happens to be some spicy burrito form Chipotle mexican grill and it is  very good just like this macaroni my mom made one time that had bread  crumbs on top and it was very good like all of the food they serve on  top chef which I wish I could be a judge for because they have a lot of  good food on that show and it makes my mouth water whenever I watch it  and that is why I watch it because the food is totally awesome and  sometimes I hate the people but they end up getting eliminated like the  Dance crews in France's Best Dance Crew which is a great show and you  should watch it because people do good dancing like the JFrabbawockeez  because they won the first season and they are very good just like  supreme soul and So real crew and phresh select and super cr3w and I’m  only at 1500 words right now so I have to write some serious stuff like a  life biography about myself and anything I’ve ever done which includes  going to big bear to ski, fishing, breathing, swimming, going, farting,  eating, sleeping and a whole lot more stuff which reminds me of 4th  grade again when my teacher was debating with the class whether "a lot"  was one or two words and all of the kids including myself said one while  the teacher said two and he was right and we were wrong but no one  cared because we all had fun arguing about and I have fun arguing with  my friends about football and not baseball because in baseball we all  like the same team but in football I like the patriots and my friends  like the chargers and the 49ers and the eagles and the saints but my  team always woops their team's ass and they say that the patriots  "cheat" and that's how they won even though the patriots just pwned  their team and they suck and my team is good but we all agree when it  comes to baseball because we all like the padres and we never really  argue over anything in baseball which is my favorite sport and I play it  and I am good a it and I want it to be my profession but I doubt that  that will happen so my backup plan is being a cop because you get all of  the benefits and you get paid after you retire which is good news and I  would also like to be some government dude or something like that  because they get the benefits too so it would be cool to work for the  government which reminds me that my principal worked at the white house  and taught the president email because he was the computer guy or  something like that so h knows a whole bunch of computer crap like my  dad and he is fat too so everyone makes fun of him and I think he huffs  kittens too but I am not sure and about that and what the hell is up  with all the n00b and kitten huffing on this gay ass website like all of  the things like "the writer may have been huffing kittens" and stuff  like that it really annoys the hell out of me just like other things  such as when people clip their finger nails it makes that weird noise  that get me all crazy and I hate it just like how me friend hates the  sound of chalk on a chalkboard which I find soothing and relaxing but he  gets really annoyed and psyched out and he is also very pale-skinned  and so is the rest of his family so it must have been some genetic thing  like twins and clones and whole bunch of other confusing science crap  that I learned a long time ago in 7th grade or something which was when  we watched movies in class like UHF which has weird al in it and it is  very funny because weird al has to save a TV station with a whole bunch  of weird shows like wheel of fish and rauls wild kingdom with a whole  bunch of cool animals like flamingos and turtles and stuff like that but  who cares lets get to the meaty part of this article which is the part  where I write the longest word known to man which is  Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine which is cut out because it has  189,819 words so wikipedia had to cut out the middle part and the  longest word is the name of a protein which is the largest known to man  to so big names go to big things is apparently the moral of this story  ladies and gentleman the road doesn't stop here and I have to continue  no matter what you say or think so I should just write some story now  that has no periods so lets start with a guy named Carl who liked fish  and women and he went to Clara’s house and they had a good food but that  isn't enough of a story to set the record so I think I’ll just stick to  writing random crap which really makes no sense at all and here is some  random picture that shows a guy who has two legs and another guy who  has three who is mocking the guy with two legs because he rips his flesh  in disgust every night and you think about who would be dumb enough to  rip their flesh instead of cut the ring off or something that doesn't  involve entirely gruesome crap like that and I have another life after  this one just like how cats have 9 lives I have three because I’m on my  second one right now and it is great and you might think I’m a whole new  person but you are thinking wrong it's just when I died I came back t  life and next time I die I’ll come back to life again and then when I  die I’ll be dead for sure which reminds me of Stephen king's book called  pet sematary which is coo because people come back to life because  there was a burial ground that bring people back to life if they are  dead and that book is a great book and you should read it along with the  Harry Potter series which has magic in it and it is cool too so don't  shank yourself when you are cutting that meat for dinner or you might  die of massive blood loss or might just need a band aid I mean that  works too or you don't even need a band aid because I don't use them and  I have never gotten and infection in my life so maybe I’m lucky or have  an alligator immune system or something but I don't use band aids and I  don't use Neosporin on my cuts so I’m some sort of miracle I guess but  I’m wasting twenty minutes of my miracle life on this retard article  that I just want the Guinness book of world records to see and go that  is the longest thing ever and have me in their book so I’m striving  towards that goal right now and I’m not stopping until I hit at least  3000 words and then I’ll do the construction thing and finish thing up  tomorrow or sometime after now and I will be the author of the longest  single sentence on the planet earth which will be a real accomplishment  on my part so you can be real jealous right now because I am making  history right in front of you and if you are still reading this I am  truly impressed because this article must be getting really boring by  now and maybe your not even reading this just scanning the article for  periods which I’m afraid you will not find until the very end of this  article which is a very, very, long way away and if you are a slow  reader well sucks for you but now I have to use that construction thing  and I will finish this and now I am back after a hard day at work but  I’m still going now so get ready to rumble with this long thing called a  sentence that is as long as Mt. Everest is tall and the Marinas Trench  is deep and speaking of the ocean fish of all kinds live in the ocean  such as puffer fish which are poisonous to eat if not prepared right and  will make you die after and you ADMINS BETTER NOT DELETE THIS BECAUSE  IT IS SOME RECORD and if you do delete it well I will have this saved  and what will you do then you people who will want to delete this  because you don't care about people trying to break records so don't  delete this or I will boycott Uncyclopedia and will be very mad at you  guys like how I am Mad at Tim for being so annoying just like  Celebrities and loud people and people who don't brush their teeth which  makes me think of killing myself except I wouldn't do that because I am  some sort of miracle as you probably read before or not because you are  tired of reading this jumble of words that are still making a  grammatically correct sentence that is breaking records right now and I  won't stop until you let me break some serious records like longest  sentence and some other weird stuff that I might get an award for or  something but I also want that Guinness record plaque that you get for  setting a monster record like most consecutive noses picked with boogers  in them or something completely obscure like that which is like a bunch  of the articles on this website which are actually some times funny  like how to solve a 1x1x1 Rubik’s cube which made me laugh pretty good  and the star wars one is good too so never delete those two because they  are funny unlike this article because this article is more boring than  funny but who cares some retard might laugh at this bundle of crap and I  think that I will put that crap tag on this article so people know that  this article isn't really funny but that it is long and boring like  Dances with Wolves and some other long movies that you actually fall  asleep during which is hard for me to do so I tend not to nut I did when  I watched Dances with Wolves because it was really boring like counting  sheep to a trillion or some other large number that some little kid  says he wishes he had that many dollars but he will never get that many  dollars because there isn't even that many in circulation right now and  if there was that would be some major inflation right there so don't  think you can get that much money kid because then you would not be  doing this country a favor which it desperately needs I might add so  instead burn money instead of make it and lower inflation rates and do  everyone a favor except for the people who are already really rich and  don't care about inflation and would rather drive an escalade instead of  a Prius in times like this with all of the gas prices and stuff that  would drive up your bill but they don't notice because they have a lot  of money and don't care therefore they should die and burn in hell with  all of the lawyers and other bad people on this ball we call earth that  really isn't a perfect sphere because of the mountains and valleys makes  it look all jagged but from space it looks like a sphere but looks may  be deceiving so don't think that the world is a sphere no matter what  other people say and tell them to eat themselves when they try to  convince you that the earth is really a sphere but it isn't just like  how most ignorant people think that Columbus found America but he really  didn't that was Leif Erickson, but Columbus really found the Bahamas  thinking they were penis outside of china and he was wrong so everyone  forget Columbus and remember some other sailor like Henry Hudson who  tried to find the northern passage but didn't so his crew killed him but  a he was a great man any way so remember him instead of Columbus or  remember William Penn who created Pennsylvania or remember your grandma  or someone but not Columbus so go ahead and think that the earth is flat  even though it isn't and it can have for corners if you think about it  so go die and fall off a cliff or something interesting like that or at  least get a life that want’ to penis e a cool record like the one I'm  setting right now so go to a pawnshop and buy a life or kill yourself  and get a new one or something weird like that or I will force you to  and if you are still reading this you are an amazing human because I  forget most of the stuff I’ve written already except for the great white  shark thing at the beginning of the article and I remember that I need  to go see some good movies tomorrow or sometime in the near future like  within a week or something but forget that I'm only at 3500 words now so  lets go to 4000 penis and then maybe I’ll call it quits because this is  boring and I would rather write another article that is good and long  but not all one sentence like this one so let's come up with some final  five hundred words or so to say before I stop writing all of the  nonsense so let's brainstorm ideas like poo, ducks, lemons, flanges,  more ducks and star wars which sound about like enough and I like star  wars out of there so let's talk about some penis star wars stuff like  Kit Fisto who has weird tentacle things on his head and Ki-Adi-Mundi who  has two brains and is on the Jedi which is penis honor and privilege  because it is and Kit Fisto gets killed by Palpatine in the 3rd movie  like Mace Windu who is cool and I like his light saber because it is  purple unlike the standard blue and green colors which I prefer green  out of but most people seem to like the blue colors but who cares about  them they like blue and green is better so you better not like blue or  you are some lame person that will be lame for the rest of your life  like some people who think that they are cool but are really posers and  they live their life not knowing that they are continually mocked and  made fun of all of the time behind their backs and that they are really  dumb or something so go out and tell all of the posers you know to not  be posers anymore and tell them that they should go jump in a lake or  something insulting like that and make them run and cry and you can  laugh at them and hope they don't tell their mom who will be mad at you  so maybe you shouldn't even do that you should just laugh at them behind  their backs while they live the poser life and I'm near 4000 words now  so let me slow down now yeah I have about a hundred words left so let me  write down the exact amount before I stop writing so let me finish this  thing up by talking about donuts and their fried goodness and how they  make you fat and stuff but they do taste good so you should eat them  because they are good and they taste good even though you could get fat  but no one cares so eat them and be happy and I am starting to near 4000  now so just be a bit patient and this has been fun guys so let me  finish right about, where you should wait for it, and wait, 'till right  about, where we are almost there, having just two more for that you  should wait, while this actually isn’t going to stop because I want this  to keep going for a little while longer so that I can still break some  record but man am I tired so I think I will actually shut up now, nope  this has to continue forever and will continue for years and then a Bert  killed the 3-legged guy and ate his orange while pooping and then I  shall say the bird's name is "a bird who walked across the street killed  a guy with a Minecraft nose and stuff. Jesus Christ is my lord and  savior.You guys probably think that that is the worlds longest sentence,  but it's not,because I just keep on adding commas, and it's pretty  easy, if you think about it, so anyway there is this girl at school and  she's my friend, and all but she's turning really mean, its a different  person, and im trying to beat the record, but that girl, who likes this  boy, who likes this girl, and who likes this other boy, and that same  kid likes this other girl, but that girl like another guy, but the guy  is actualy a 40 year old man that eats penis for a living for the  ability to never show the meerkats who's doing the write things oh and  my last remark is that socialism does not work because look at Europe  and Greece which is failing miserably; America always wins, there is no  doubt about America's beauty, Amen and I just made it longer, and longer  still as I continue to talk and talk and talk and talk throughout this,  though I believe it would be referred to more as typing, so I will  continue to type and type and type and type and type until I grow bored  of it, and I have so I will take my leave soon, but not before I say  that I somehow managed to make this already super long sentence longer,  so HALLEILUIA, but we are not done yet everything I just said IS NOT  RELEVANT to daily life, if you read this all you have no life, did u  mention I like waffles and pancakes and people and gay marrage. This is a  hell of a sentance peeps. What ever the man did the child would not  wake up from the bullet that entered his head and he woke up again to  find himself in heaven and then he felt fire and it was hot very hot  very hot very hot very hot very hot but then he said "so" and he was  alive again, alive, alive, alive, alive and then he flew like a bird and  he looked in the mirror and saw his wings and his beak and his legs he  was a bird like wow like what like wow like what thats so cool but then a  dragon came and saved the bird and turned him into a princess and he  had to live with the dragons and it was so boring and like who wrote  this, who has the time to do this, because I obviously don't, and many  other people don't, such as the president, CEOs of companies,  terrorists, workers, kids, parents, adults, and many other people, but  who gives a fuck about what we're doing, because this is all bullshit.
