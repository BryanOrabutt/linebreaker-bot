I either need a hugger in my life or I should become one. You were that for me. You hugged me every time you've seen me...except lately. By lately I mean the past year when everything changed. I kind of miss you and your quirky enthusiastic energy. I wish I was like that all the time. So much time has passed, it feels more like a dream than a memory. Everything was different, you were different, I was oh-my-God so different. In a good way and in a bad way. We won't think about that. I had an observer's perspective yesterday. Around people, in town... I liked it. I was distanced from everything and I felt no pressure to do anything, yet I wanted to. I didn't worry about it one bit. I just remembered that line "if they like you for who you pretend to be, then why all this? if they don't like you for *you*, you don't need them. and someone else will like you and you'll like them." And that's how you make friends. F$ck. I should have a bigger personality. My personality when I'm having an awesome day, listening to music, SINGING LOUDLYY CAUSE IT'S FUUN, and DANCING like an IDIOT cause THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO. Well fine, I can't do all of those things in public hah, but I'm too passive, boring. Why do my friends hang out with me? F$ck, even I don't like myself when I'm anxious and quiet and boring. And I am like that around certain people. And it doesn't really go away. I'm not fully comfortable around them. So maybe I should get new people around which I'll be comfortable and around which I won't be f$cking quiet and anxious and worry whether they want me because I'm so aggreeable and a plus one person to have just in case. I mean HEY, they count, AND they blend with the background. Don't lie to me. I know you like me, I'm not paranoid. But I'm a sponge for human emotions and I KNOW when somebody ACTUALLY likes me and doesn't just want me AROUND. To end this on a high note... Mariah Carey Emotions. Try that. Your vocal chords will.be.fried.
