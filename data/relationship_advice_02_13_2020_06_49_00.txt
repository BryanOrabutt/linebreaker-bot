Well I’ve never done this before. Put anything personal online like what I’m feeling and everything. I usually keep a journal around for that but my friend showed me this app. He signed me up and helped me um learn how to do this i guess. I still don’t know what community I should put this in.  Maybe as a rant or is it to myself I don’t know. Well I guess it’s more of a rant.  Well I’m in love with my best friend. He knows I’m In love with him but I know he doesn’t feel the same way as I do but like when I’m with him I think he is starting to fall In love with me. This could just be me overthinking it and it just be that he thinks of me as just a friend. Like when me and him are together both of our problems go away. Me and him can just be ourselves around each other. We always have a fun/amazing time. We are also really inseparable.  He says he is really happy where things are with us right now and I am to but he also says he doesn’t want anything to change but I know they will.  Once he gets a girlfriend everything changes. I get heartbroken. He will be happy ( which I will be happy for him) but he also will feel bad because he doesn’t want to hurt me. We promised each other we will always be there for each other and in each other’s life forever but I don’t want to get hurt again. Should I distant myself from him? Should I stay and get hurt in the long run? I don’t know what to do. Also it’s like when we argue we always come back to each other with a stronger bond. Honestly I don’t want to get hurt again. But either way I get hurt or we both get hurt. I honestly don’t want to hurt him. He is the most amazing and the most important person to me. He is also the person I fell in love with and can’t see my life without him in it. I just don’t know what to do.
