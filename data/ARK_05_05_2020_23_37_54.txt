(First time posting on Reddit so excuse anything I do wrong) this is a warning to anyone looking to buy ark or start playing official servers I have been playing are since legacy over 4K hours played and was there for every new map and update and can confirm wildcard and the ark devs do not care about the game and player base the main exploits in the game meshing(getting under the map) and duping have been in the game since the beginning and they have only started to fix them recently years of the exploits ruining the game I had a base is a spot know as pearl cave on the center get mashed for a week straight as we put in tickets and defended with the rail gun but ended up loosing months of work to the exploit I stopped playing the Gabe fir a shot time but ended up coming back but recently I got affected by a bug in the game the devs knew about but didn’t put out an immediate fix or anything in the game to tell us about it all there was was a single tweet the glitch caused you to loose your character after doing an ascension for those who don’t know ascensions are the hardest bosses usually taking weeks to prepare and are no easy task my tribe had been playing the new map genesis since release and where one of the biggest tribes on server we ran the boss multiple times and failed it to perfect our strategy the map has been out for about 2 months and I had been playing over 10 hours a day since then we beat the boss watched the cutscenes then poof characters deleted we only keep a week worth of ele in our generators and Metal structures auto decay in a week or so so we all submitted tickets after about 4 days of waiting we finally got directed to a website where we could set a date to get our tribe and characters back and to see the earliest date was July 23rd 79 days and was told they can’t completely replace my character only some of the tek engrams and up to lvl 105 nothing more my character I lost was lvl 131 with every tek engram except the ones given from genesis sorry for those who read all of this but I had to get this out and I’m finally quitting the game
