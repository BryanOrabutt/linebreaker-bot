I'm just so frustrated with CenturyLink lately, and their customer service seems to be getting progressively worse over the past few years. My issue lately is slow upload speed. I pay for 10M upload and 768k download. Speedtests and even the admin page in the router show average connections are 7M/203k ... yes, that's 203 kbps upload. It means dozens of times per hour websites fail to load from either DNS lookup timeouts or TLS setup errors/timeout. And forget about sending facebook messenger photos/video over this connection to friends and family. Download speed is okay in the mornings having speedtests sometimes showing almost near the 10 Mpbs but in the evenings it usually maxes out at 5 Mbps. \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/WWj4VLx.png](https://i.imgur.com/WWj4VLx.png)) I think it's a congestion/space issue at the DSLAM, and here's why i think so: About 4 years ago I had the TV+Phone+Internet package and had double-bonded VDSL2+ ... 4 wires which is 2 ports on a card in the DSLAM. (sorry if some of my terminology is wrong here). I got actual 10Mbps internet simultaneous with TV service. They told me at that time I could get 20Mbps if I got rid of the TV service. I ended up eventually turning off TV and phone and just staying on 10Mbps to save money. Fast forward to this year, and now representatives are telling me 10Mbps is the max available in my area, not 20Mbps anymore. I had a tech come out to troubleshoot my connection a few months ago, and the issue was that 2 pairs were hooked up in the NID (gray outdoors box) and the tech said the modem would never connect to DSL that way because its supposed to be ADSL2+ not VSDL2+. The modem had always connected on 2 pairs before, nobody touched the NID, but during a reboot it decided it would now always refuse to connect if there was 2 pairs present, and sure enough using the single pair it now connects to ADSL2+. What that tells me is that they're trying to pack more customers into the DSLAM without adding any new hardware in there, or perhaps there's not enough bandwidth making its way down to the local DSLAM from the main cable vault building in this town. (I live in a rural area.) In the last few years there has been maybe 50%+ houses built within range of the DSLAM (18,000 feet???). I am about 5000 feet from the DSLAM and my line noise is horrible. Several techs have told me this before. The modem DSL stats page shows 9dB SNR for both up and down, shows 32dB attenuation down, 19dB attenuation up. \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/Hpwj64G.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hpwj64G.png)) With some googling I found SNR numbers should be more like 20-30dB and up... and the attenuation should be 40-20dB and down. So my SNR is bad, and attenuation okay. Last night my speed was so slow I just quit trying to use the computer. I called CenturyLink and the tech walked me though all the normal crap... reboot, checking for account problems, all kinds on line checks on the reps end somehow. He gave me some verbal run-around avoiding telling me what the upstream speeds should be... but after being stern I got him to tell me it should be 768kbps and that's what I'm paying for. He said everything was fine and there's no internet issues and to make sure I don't have too many programs open on my computer and that I should use ethernet cable (i am) instead of wifi, \*sigh\* ... I read him the numbers from my stats page, told the rep my upstream connection was 149kbps at the time and I can't accept that. He ended up telling me the modem must be bad and for $100 I can order a new one and it \*should\* fix the problem. He argued with me that modems just go bad sometimes, and sometimes the upsteam connection speed (and not download or anything else) can suffer and the modem has to be replaced. Bullshit. Really pisses me off because the rep would not schedule a tech to come out to troubleshoot. I politely but quickly ended the call. Worrying the line noise might be something on my end, I had to try something. I bypassed the NID and even the crimp connections on the utility pole little box, and wired a DSL jack right into freshly cut wires coming down the utility pole where the overhead phone lines enter my property. Literally plugged the modem in at the new jack on the utility pole and the numbers were the same 9dB SNR. It's something on their end. I had a previous different modem that still had sucky speed a few years ago, and the tech at the time (2 different techs in fact) said it was the line somewhere between DSLAM and NID, nothing to do with modem. What am I to do? CenturyLink prices suck. I pay $45/mo + $8 "gateway equipment fee" for my 10M/0.2M \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/8aaE7VR.png](https://i.imgur.com/8aaE7VR.png)) ... and about 45 minutes away the residents can get 100M for $49/mo or 940M fiber for $65/mo. So damn frustrating. And there's no other ISPs in this area.
