He has had 8 years to build a contending team. He hasn’t done that at all! We’re going to miss the playoffs for the fourth time in 5 years and yet he is still managing this fucking team... This is getting beyond frustrating to me. I watched the Bruins today and I was like “wow there’s a team that can go far, there’s a team that can contend for the Cup”. It fucking kills me to see all the talent other teams have and we don’t. Bergevin was given 8 years to build this team. The only time we got close to the cup finals was in 2013-14 and that team wasn’t even modelled by Bergevin. Now he’s about to miss the playoffs 4 of the past 5 years and he’s not even on the fucking hot seat???? This is truly just pathetic. As long as he is the fucking GM of this team we’re gonna be mediocre. All this guy wants is to make the playoffs. He doesn’t give a fuck about the Cup. He basically says “Well our goal is to make the playoffs and once we get there anything can happen. Just look at the Blues.” Well guess what Marc the Blues roster is MUCH better than the dogshit one you built. And I don’t even care about the prospects right now. Suzuki, Kotkaniemi and Caufield look pretty good and they should be our best pieces moving forward. But he’s had 8 years... 8 YEARS!!!!! If I had to describe his tenure as GM in one word it would be MEDIOCRE. He makes good trades but that is all he cares about. He’s so scared of losing trades that he never takes a big risk that might potentially pay off. Look at the fucking Raptors in the NBA. They took a huge risk with Kawhi knowing that he probably wouldn’t resign and giving up their best player who wanted to be a Raptor for life. That fucking risk brought them the championship. They took the swing for the championship and it payed off. That’s exactly what Bergevin’s problem is: he’ll never risk his job for the benefit of his team and that mindset is killing us and will continue to kill us until Molson finally realizes he’s not the man for the job.
