I go to claim Hex -- I go to the Ledger via Electrum and ( not really sure why I have to do this actually - whats the whole Electrum thing have to do with the fact that I purchased BTC - I stored it - sent it to my Ledger ? ) when I add the address and the send to address from the Hex Claim web site -- get an error from Electrum that the address is not in the wallet? What wallet ? The Electrum Wallet ? Sure I get that -- why would it be in the Electrum wallet - that is not where I sent my Bitcoin to in the first place - and to tell you the truth - why in the hell would I do that -- I purchased a Ledger hardware device to store my BTC on -- I didn't buy BTC to send it to the Ledger then send it off of the ledger and store it then into an Electrum wallet - why would I do that ? Makes no sense -- then lets think about it - the transaction is on blockchain.info -- you can see it there -- I bought it - so why is HEX making this so difficult for me to claim free Hex ? When I started my Hex venture here a week ago I was under the impression that if you had BTC HODL on or before Dec 3 2019 then you can claim free Hex -- why all the runaround getting signatures to claim free Hex - why would I send my BTC over to some Electrum Wallet to Sign the address to then get free Hex -- this whole process seems like utter rubbish to me ... but in any event yes I would like to claim free Hex but why is it such a pain in to do that ? You would think that you can verify transactions via blockchain.info -- so lets say you want to store your BTC on a Ledger - then why cant you claim it if you do ? Then you get into this whole craziness about MULTISIG / SEGWIT / LEGACY -- I have watched some videos on this subject but look -- I thought it would all be much easier to claim free Hex then all this ? Any thoughts ?
