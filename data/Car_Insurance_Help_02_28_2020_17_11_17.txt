Im from Georgia and I need help. So I am 19 but still in school living with my dad and we share the same car insurance since the car I drive is technically his I just help pay it off. After the accident we had noticed I was an excluded driver my dad has been with this agency for years and everyone had forgotten I was excluded since the paperwork was done when I was 16 I didn’t even know because I wasn’t even there when it happened. Anyway I had gotten into an accident 2 weeks ago and on the police report it stated that the other driver (OD for short) was at fault it was very obvious at the time we were going through a road that’s only gravel (these are common where I live) and we got to a curve I was in my lane but OD was speeding on the middle of the road he ended up damaging my drivers side front and back doors, I didn’t think to take any photos of the tire marks because as I stated it was very obviously there fault cars needed to get through and I didn’t want to move my car so OD  moved his by the time the police with the paperwork I was let go and OD was given a ticket. My insurance agent files a claim with OD’s agency and sends them the police report, days later I call OD’s agency and they said they thought I was the one who got the citation even though it was clearly stated  on the police report it was  so my agency sends the paperwork again about a week later I call OD’s agency again and they state they won’t pay for it because they go by the words of their driver so now my insurance company won’t cover it because I was an excluded driver but I told them anyway to see if there was something they could do they call OD’s agency and they say that they’re standing ground and are still refusing to pay my insurance say there’s nothing they can do. I don’t know what to do anymore I have things to do far school and I also have to babysit and I’m currently looking for a new job my dad doesn’t speak English that well so I have to handle this too and I feel like I’m way past my breaking point what do I do?
