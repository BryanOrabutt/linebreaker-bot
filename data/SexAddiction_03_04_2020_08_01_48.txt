okay so, my sisters friend, named let’s say Ally, was a heroin addict & would leave her dog by herself for max 2 weeks, with no water or food. So, her dad, named ummm Randy, is a truck driver & isn’t home very often, would return from traveling & the dog would be by itself, dog poop & pee everywhere. My sister was asked by Randy if she knew anyone who could take care of the dog, other wise he’d have to give her away & that’d be an impossible decision for him. Of course she asked me because i love dogs & i agreed. So for about 6 months, the dog would bounce back in forth from me, to Randy, because Ally would sober up & come home so she was able to care for the dog & take her back. But, as time went on, & the longer Ally would relapse & the dog would stay with me for months on end, i grew to be so close to the dog & love her & care for her like an owner. i felt like she was my child lol. She started to get close to me too, everyone noticed. She’d cry when i wasn’t around or if i left her home, she’d freak out & jump up & down when i’d come home, like she legit would bark & cry me & bite my shoelaces off & pee cause she’d be so excited. people were surprised when i say i’m just babysitting. we would snuggle all night, she listened to me i wouldn’t have to walk her with a leash, she went EVERYWHERE with me. Appts, grocery shopping, parties, friends houses, restaurants, LIKE EVERYWHERE. If i couldn’t bring her somewhere, i’d be so sad & feel so bad cause i knew she cry & stuff. i spent a lot of money buying her cute sweaters, nice dog bed & dog bowls, toys, good shampoo. so anyways, i’ve recently had to move out of state, & i brought the dog with me. i wasn’t able to keep the dog with me forever because one, my landlord wouldn’t allow it, & 2 she wasn’t really my dog. so i told Randy & he said he’d look for someone to take care of her back in the other state. i went back to that state to pick up the rest of my belongings & unfortunately, drop off the dog with Randy. I have been completely devastated having to give her back. I miss her so much, her company, her love. i’m worried for to be taken care of by someone she doesn’t know. i feel like i’m grieving a loss, when i think about her it brings me to instant tears. i know she’s not my dog, but i can’t help but feel like she was, because of how close we were. she was like a best friend. when i first got her i was in a bad place mentally, dealing with anxiety & depression. having her gave me purpose & made me feel loved. she brought me out of a dark place, i started becoming dependent on her for making me feel better, & she always did. now that i don’t have her, i feel alone & sad. i want her back sooo bad. idk what to do, idk if it’s wrong.
