I had a really weird dream... and i usually do not remember any dream, it started that i was going trough my life and i had a really bad time, i was really depressed then I heard a voice that started talking to me and he asked about my problems, then he offered me another life, a better life that would be much better and I said yes. so there i am waking up in the middle of a town that looked really special because there where really tall buildings and every structure was the same. I went in the first one that was the closest to me and entered, the building had spiral staircases made out of wood and on every floor where 2 rooms whit different numbers painted in gold, i got to the 3 or 4 floor and nocked on the door, two old ladies asked me if i want anything, and i asked them where i was so they grabbed me and i was in their room, it was like an old house but still nice. The grandma grabbed a bag and gave it to me, in there was mdma acid dmt and another drug that i didnâ€™t recognize it was blue on one side and white on the other side, it had som letters and numbers on it they where small and she gave me like 50 of those, a acid plate that was gray and id had like a god on it and the mdma was yellow and had a girl on it that looked like a siren? And on the other side there where letters, the dmt looked like dmt ðŸ˜‚ , then they let me out whit out-an answer where i was and again i was in that town so i walked around looking everywhere and it was a really nice town, i grabbed my bag and took the mdma, i didnâ€™t swallow it instantly and it my mouth was full of powder, i took that down whit some water that i didnâ€™t even have before, i had really nice effects and it seemed so real yeah and basically the dream is about me all the drugs in the process of walking around the city, the mdma made me see everything clearer, then i took 4 tabs of acid and everything was red but it was like floating red dots, a guy came up too me and he took my bag, looked at me and then gave it back and gone he was. It seemed like all the time that i had someone nearby that talked to me but i didnâ€™t see anyone i woke up at the last second i was trying the dmt. This blew my mind cause it seemed so real.
