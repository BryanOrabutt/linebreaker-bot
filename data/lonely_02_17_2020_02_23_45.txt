Where to begin? Well lets see, I've been friends with this one girl since middle school, and somewhere along the way, I started having feelings for her in high school, how'd I find this out? Well, one of my ex-friends asked me if it would be okay if he went out with her, and at first I said yes and thought nothing of it at first, only to actually think about it later during class and only then to feel my heart hurting, then another friend of mine had told me about what kind of person the guy was, and it from what I heard, it wasn't good so I had tried to break them up out of her own safety, and I succeded though that may have more than likely killed any and all chances of being together with her as I had confessed my own feelings, and got turned down, I went out with other girls after, but nothing clicked or something was wrong, one was an on and off relationship, and the other I had actually legit loved, but that was false because that ex confessed to me that she never actually loved me, and that she forced herself to love me so you can imagine what that did to my confidence, fast forward years later, I'm hanging out with my friend that had turned me down amd for a while I thought I might have had a chance again, only to have life slap me across the face yet again when she asked me to go with her to make sure everything was okay because she was meeting her online boyfriend from TF2 and their love was real too, since then it's been almost a decade, she had moved to a far off place within the state with her mom and boyfriend, with plans to move put of state because of cheaper housing, mind you I've still not given up, the smart, normal, and right thing would've been to let it go and carry on, but I refused to be normal because to hell with that, if I let this go, I'm going to regret this, knowing full well that even rejecting the truth of moving on and to keep going after her would lead to regret, because if she goes, she's never coming back. Each night, I'm thinking of her, and it's twisting me from the inside, distorting my views, amd just recently my best friend that I've known since elementary school had announced that he plans to move to out of state as well just to get out of this god forsaken state, I mean sure I've other friends, but these two have been with me for the longest part of my life, and the fact they both have plans to go somewhere else is breaking me. I know I shouldn't complain, I can't complain, I can never complain, because they're doing what they want to do, but they're going somewhere I can't follow, even if and after I get myself together and have the means to do so, and if I say anything I'm the bad guy. My best friend that I could legit count on for anything and the girl I'm in love with are going to leave me behind. So here I am, a nobody with two of the greatest friends anyone could've asked for, getting left behind to rot and wallow in self pity even if and after I get myself together and sorted out.
