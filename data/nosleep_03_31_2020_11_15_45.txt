So in this is the story of how I was encountered by a demon at 8 years old I was sitting in my aunt's living room and me and my cousin were tired from running around the house but we walked to the kitchen cause we were hungry I didn't think anything of it but my cousin is older but no matter that we have a great bond but he jumped and I've never seen him scared but he looked genuinely terrified and I looked in the direction he was looking at horrified but before I could he hurried me in the living room and said time for bed being a bratty 8 year old I complained he said fine and let me watch tv my aunt was out with my other cousin shopping so he was in charge now I was getting tired watching tv so I told my cousin and he set up my place on the floor he said I'll be back in a little to check on you I drifted off too sleep but woke up around 3:15 and looked around as do to this day but tonight I was scared I just tried laying my head down and then i heard it when I thought it was just my imagination but there it was again three slow rhythmic knocking I thought it was my cousin at first but he'd wouldn't do that at least not this late so I looked at the door and froze in terror as I saw face with red eyes and a black face I could make out its face if it even had on the knocking continued getting louder but keeping the same rhythmic tone i tried calling for my cousin my aunt anyone but the words were caught in my thought I couldnt move either i was stuck in place not knowing what to do he knocked rhythmically for about 30 seconds then left but before completely put of my sight he turn and gave me a smile with white teeth pure white but there was nothing friendly about that smile it was a menacing smile that I didnt know was possible was eight years old when this first encounter happened and I hoped I never saw it again but boy was I wrong I had was sitting there terrified in the living room when the thing was finally outta sight I ran to my cousin's room and told him what happened but all he did was mutter I should've put you in my room. I asked what he meant and he told me earlier he saw something similar to what I described only the thing was in the form of a homeless man with a demented smile I was crying and I was hugging my cousin I made so much noise that my aunt and my other cousin woke I didn't know they were home but my cousin lied and said I had a nightmare and he's trying to help i just nodded and agreed we stayed up the rest of that morning in case that thing came back it never did at least for awhile. So my next encounter with what I assume was the same or different creature but I do remember at this time I was 12 and we moved to our new apartment in a suburb area and for awhile everything was fine but one night my mother had to work and I stayed home alone which didn't really concern me until I was in my room and I looked out my window and saw a wolf like creature but what was different was when I look it look at me and had red eyes I hadn't thought about that night for awhile now and now it was fresh in my head but i thought to myself it can't be the same thing right or could it my thoughts were changing back to this thing is the same thing i saw 4 years ago because when it looked at me it gave me the same smile as before as white and as menacing as the last time then leaped into the wooded area of our apartment complex with an inhuman howl and i sat on my bed that night and just cradled myself.
