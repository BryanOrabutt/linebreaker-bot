Hello all, so my boyfriend and I have an almost 3 year old reef tank and within the last month in a half we added 2 Condy Anemones and a GSP. Everyone in the tank is doing really well, our fish are starting to breed yadda yadda. But Iâ€™ve been noticing that our GSP is not opening. Please bare in mind that this is our very first reef tank and we do visit our LFS very often as they are trusted but due to the coronavirus we have been frequenting it less. The woman who sold us the GSP said we did not need to buy Reef Riods as the GSP will catch floating particles in the tank and only to use RR if we wanted it to grow faster. After telling us it will take about a week or two for our GSP to fully come out we waited. The first 3 days it was doing very well it wasnâ€™t fully blooming but I could tell it was enjoying the spot we put it in. Fast forward to now a little over a month later and we do not see our GSP. I went in two days ago after not seeing it for weeks and I cleaned off a bunch of algae from it as it had gotten pretty dirty from hiding. Yesterday he was out but just a little bit and apart of me started wondering if maybe we should be feeding it RR. At this point I feel terrible if we should have been feeding it and we havenâ€™t. I feel disappointed in our LFS for not educating us more, as they know us and know we are not very experienced. So my baseline question is can I feed my GSP the Reef Roids if it is all closed up? Will it be able to get food that way? Iâ€™m so worried about it and I want it to start looking as beautiful as it was when we picked it out at the storeðŸ˜¢ one of the learning curves of fish hobby I suppose. (Yes, my boyfriend and I ended up ordering a can of reef riods from Amazon so we do have some on the way to us as Iâ€™m typing this)
