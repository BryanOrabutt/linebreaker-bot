So this whole thing started two years ago, my then girlfriend was always haggling me about getting into the gym I was 350 pounds had a heavy drinking problem and was in the worst shape of my life so I finally gave in and got a gym membership with her, flash forward a year and I’ve lost 100 pounds and am feeling amazing about myself for once while she gave up within two months and I had decided then to set two goals for myself my short term goal compete in a local strongman competition coming up in a few months my long term goal to compete in worlds strongest man in the not so near future (yes very big aspirations I know) so I’ve been putting my nose to the grindstone and have been working as hard as possible four days a week sometimes up too three hours a night September comes around we get married and I’m feeling awesome about looking good for my wedding everything is fine until about a month later when she starts complaining about my new hobby, about how much food I’m eating, about how long I spend at the gym, about how I’m not spending enough time with her ( I set aside Wednesday evening and all weekend to do things with here) yet when it comes time to do things she never wants too, she always has plans with somebody else or doesn’t want to do the things I try to plan then complains about me “not being spontaneous anymore, it has culminated to the point now where she is demeaning my dreams, constantly calling me through my gym sessions “why are you still at the gym? You’re wasting your time, you’re never going to compete it’s not realistic” I’ve tried to talk to her and explain to her that I’ve finally found a healthy productive lifestyle and aspirations that I’m fully committed too, but she can’t seem to come to terms with that, when I do spend time with her all she wants to do is fight about all the tine I spend away from her, I don’t know if she’s jealous of what I’ve done with myself in the tine she wasnt committed or if she’s mad I’m not interested in participating in her hobby ( she wants me to quit training for strongman and come be part of her families racing team but I have no interest in taking that up)  I’m not sure what to do, reasoning with her gets me no where and I’m tired of constantly being brought down and demeaned by her for the things I want to do, sometimes I think she wants me to become a lazy drunk who’s completely dependent on her for my happiness, any advice on how to handle the situation?
