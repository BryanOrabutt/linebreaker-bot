My story started off when I was 5 me and my mom bought a new house right after my dad passed away from a MURDER (we never found his body but the guy that killed him confessed). We wanted a small house just to rent for the next 2 or so years so my mom could save up enough money for a bigger house, it was a house abandon in the middle of a corn felid and no houses around it meaning no people around us. My mom was working at a horse barn not to far from the small house we where renting so she could walk there. One day my mom went off to work and I was home alone I turned 6 at the time so she wanted to work to get me a few gifts and a cake, my aunt came over for a bit but had to leave to do some other stuff so then it was just me, I was sitting down in the living room playing with crayons and books and then here a big thud, I was the only one there we had no pets and it wasnâ€™t just a sound my house made. So I went up stairs and into my moms room because thatâ€™s where it was, my mom has a porch that Lead to a shed but we didnâ€™t have a key to the shed so we never went in it plus it was locked. When I got to her room a big box was on the bed but it wasnâ€™t there before because my crayons where on her bed after she left and the box wasnâ€™t there. KEEP IN MIND IM A CURIOS 6 YEAR OLD, so I open the box and Iâ€™m there is a key and the only place with a lock is the shed, so I put on my rain boots and go down the porch stars and open the shed,ðŸš¨THIS NEXT PART IS SCAREY) I open is and there is my dads raw body, bloody,scars every where, only part that was missing on him was his face, my mom came home to see me paralyzed and I showed her the body her heart stoped as she fell to the ground she was just in shock. Now I am 15 years old living with my aunt because my mom committed suicide when I was 12 now this is a story Iâ€™ll never forget
