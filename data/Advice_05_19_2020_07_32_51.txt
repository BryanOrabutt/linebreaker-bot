I'm 14m and have no friends. My only friend I play with online, on my pc. I love my pc, I code, 3d model, develop games and software and also play games. No one understands me. At school I have no friends and can't get any work done. I have ADHD and diagnosed depression and I'm on meds. My parents are really controlling. When other kids my age are doing fucked up shit I'm sitting here on my pc programming. They make me come down every night to watch TV for no reason, and recently I just asked my mum to go away. She reacted badly and started screaming at me. I locked my door and told them to leave me alone. They basically said if I don't come out they'll take my pc. I didnt come out. When I unlocked my door my mum said she wouldn't take it away. But they did. I went violent and uncontrollable rage like before I was on my meds. I was so mad. I spend a day at home meant to be doing school but I don't. My mum is a heartless bitch and doesn't understand. They want me to read a book or some shit. I cant read, I phase in and out of paragraphs and can't concentrate. Anyway, I went on campus to school today and had a horrible day, in the car my mum said I still wasn't getting it back for days and I got mad. We got home and she still wasn't talking. I got mad again after some argument, and can't believe this is happening because I got my door locked. I grabbed a bunch of food and water, and brought it upstairs, my mum screamed at me for my phone, and I wouldn't give it to her, she said to me , 'fuck you'. And now I'm in my room with s chair against the door, I've taken 3 sleeping pills, with a bottle of water and 3 nut bars. To reiterate I can't just wait until I get it back, my brain won't let me. I don't want to call any support numbers because it seems I'm just a stupid spoilt brat. All I know is that they are torturing me for no reason and I just want it to be over. What the fuck do I do
