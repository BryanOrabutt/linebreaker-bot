My budgie Pear, who was like a daughter to me, unfortunately passed away and I kind of caused her death. It was that I loved her too much and when she was sick, I naively followed the advice of someone I shouldn’t have and it ended up killing her. I am in mourning still, but whats worse is that the one who was left behind is my other budgie Fig. I go to college so Fig is left alone home with music playing in a dimly lit room (because my grandparents turn off the lights on him and wont let me keep it on. They think it’s ridiculous to have the lights on for him which makes me mad but I cant do anything about it when Im out of the house). Fig is lonely, I can tell. He always followed Pear around and is desperate for another birds interaction so he sings to the parakeet on this box for his play gym and to the mirror. I feel bad because I don't know how to play with him or react anymore. Pear was completely different and we bonded easily. Everything came easy with Pear and I haven’t bonded well with Fig. He gets nippy and he always flies away from me and is active. The best description I can give him is either crazy 3 year old or ADHD. Pear on the other hand was calm and quiet and loved sitting near me. I don't know what to do because I cant get another bird. Im not ready for that and I cant afford to pay medical bills like I had to with Pear. My mom wont allow me to get another bird as well, and she even suggested to me to give Fig up, which I cant because If I don’t  have him, Id come home to a quiet house and I cant live like that. Sometimes he’s extremely affectionate with me, to the point where you’d think he loved me a lot, but then he turns a 180 and bites me without warning. Please if anyone can give me any advice it’d be much appreciated. Im not a bad bird parent, Im just trying my best and I just lost my feather baby so everything is really hard right now.
