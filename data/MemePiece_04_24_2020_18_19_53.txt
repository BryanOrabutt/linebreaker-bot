So after the big hype we had in the last chapter when the flying six arrived and kaido mentioned something about his son showing up, after a break oda gave us chapter 978 unfortunately unlike to what majority wanted to see, kaido son was  not revealed however we managed to see not only the alliance journey toward Onigashima we also were revealed all six members of this group.First lets talk about the alliance,It has successfully managed to sneak into kaido lair by using kinemon technique "Kin grand store" which changes the costume of one person so that it may not be recognized. Kinemon has managed to even persuade the pirates to change their costume because if they had a frontal assault it will be unlikely for alliance to win,now the alliance will manage to sneak onto kaido when he is busy feasting however the problem is that the costumes can be removed very easily so it is also very dangerous, we also saw different troops of kaido army somehow Big mom children are also there, now the flying six include X Drake ,Page one,Uruti,Whos Who,Black Maria and Sasaki they are probably the strongest in Kaido army after the commanders some might be even stronger then commander i say this because they were talking about Queen death in such an easy way that it was [surprising. ](https://surprising.Like)they even went on asking about who will be next if he dies on which drake replies he is not interested, the flying six were called by [Kaido.Now](https://Kaido.Now) this was a short summary of the chapter now to theories: First i think it maybe like what happened at sanji wedding that luffy caused havoc by causing trouble and destroying the cake now here we have more then 5000 samurais in Onigashima so if they start trouble it will spread like fire and i think it will spread due to either Luffy or Kidd. Second they will be helped from the inside by X drake because he is a secret agent working to put down Kaido. Thirdly we dont know how big mom made that alliance with Kaido but i am of the mind that Her children are not happy with it so when they see luffy they will try to kill him for what he did at wedding while the kaido army  will try to stop them due to which we might see Big mom children vs kaido army. Lastly since we already know that luffy is not yet a Yonko level so in order to defeat one he will have a lot of help, since there are two i think that both emperors will start fighting with each other. This is all i got sorry if u did not liked it if u have any suggestion please comment
