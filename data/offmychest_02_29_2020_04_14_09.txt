If you take antidepressants and are completely happy with it and doing well please do not hate on me as I just need to say what I feel and get it off my chest. I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for years. I’ve always been on the fence about medications. Well today I got a prescription for Prozac. I took one as soon as I got in my car and I was so incredibly happy. I finally have medicine. I can finally get a grip on my life. Well. Fast forward to tonight. I have been reading on reddit and the internet in general about the pros and cons and I just kept noticing that yes they have helped people and reduced their anxiety and changed their lives but eventually they have to come off of them and it’s hell. No matter how long they taper off. And a lot of times their mental problems are waiting for them not long after stopping the medications. Also they can cause permanent brain damage, and have horrific side effects. I want to deal with my anxiety and depression now. I don’t want to cover it up and return to it years down the road. I don’t want to alter my mind or do permanent damage. I’ve noticed that more and more people are coming to realizations that these meds aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. Anyways. I got up off my couch. Paused my show. And flushed my Prozac. I didn’t even think about it I just did it. I had instant regret because I was so happy about getting those pills but I just don’t think I want to go down that road. It seems like an easy fix to me and idk something about them just sketches me out. I have horrible anxiety and ocd and I was so excited. But. Idk why I just don’t think it’s right for me. I smoked weed for 3 years almost daily and recently quit 3 weeks ago. I think half my anxiety and dark thoughts are from my brain just trying to recover from that and I need to wait at least a few months and go from there. I don’t know what I’m going to tell my doctor.
