So I have a 4 year old Pitbull, very very sweet with people. And he used be very sweet with any kind of dog small or large, male or female didn’t matter. Until last year our neighbors friend would always come by with his Rottweiler who was about 2/3 years old male and we let our dogs meet and his dog attacked mine and this was the first time I’ve ever seen my dogs teeth or face show any time of aggression. Asshole still brought his dog around my house but I won’t get into that. After this encounter my dog slowly started being very skeptical about any new big dog. Then over time small dogs too. Now he doesn’t like any new dogs at all. Only dogs he still associates with like my dogs back at home. So this became a big issue recently this year because a lot of people around my new neighborhood walk their dogs off their leash, my dog is always on a leash. And if their dog comes up to mine, well there will be a fight. As of this past weekend was my worst experience. I was walking Odin ( that’s my dogs name) and I saw this medium sized dog around the corner so I was like let’s turn around and avoid this. Well the dog comes off the leash running and attacking Odin. Now Odin is still much bigger than this dog so I’m trying my best to restrain my dog while the owners try and grab there’s. So I’m holding him up by his harness trying to keep him from biting and the other dog is jumping up to him biting and scratching. At some point Odin got him, had him by the neck. I freaked out and yes I know this next part wasn’t smart but I don’t care. I put my hands in Odins mouth and tried to pull it open. Well he let go and they had their dog. Both dogs are perfectly fine! I actually came out worse than the both of them.  So I do have a dog trainer I’m looking at in the area that helps with aggressive behavior but if anyone has any advice on how to work on it or prevent this in the time being, I would appreciate it so much.
