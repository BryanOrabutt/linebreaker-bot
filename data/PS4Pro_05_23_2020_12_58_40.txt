So Iâ€™ve been facing this strange issue .... one day i was playing overwatch on my ps4 pro when all of a sudden my screen started to flicker .... I thought maybe my hdmi was acting up ! Turns out my 4k tv was at fault so i connected it to my 720p tv and it ran fine but then it shut off on me all of a sudden as if the power chord has been disconnected or the mains switch has been turned off .... I was confused .... so I took it to a repair shop where he turned off my boost mode , deep hdmi color output and changed display from 1080 to 720 and it ran fine in his shop .... i brought it back home played for like an hour and then again the same thing ! It shut off out of the blue ! And when I touched my ps4 it was hot like really hot ! But the thing was i was getting no warning about heating or anything like that ! So I let it rest for that day and next day i played and it did start and played for like an hour and again ! It shut off and was really hot on touch .... and when I tried the same thing of letting it rest and play again it would just boot to the home screen of the game and would ahut off within 2-4 minutes... i watched some youtube tutorials and reinitialised my ps4 to no avail ... i gave my ps4 for repairing again and the repair shop told me theyâ€™ll get the all the ic checked and psu checked too .. i told them that get the thermal paste replaced but then well corona hit us for the lockdown ... now when shops are reopening in my country and i asked him wether he changed the thermal paste he said yes i did and it didnt do anything ... which was kind of strange considering that he changed the thermal pste and still isnt charging me a single penny ðŸ˜ª Im giving up on that repair shop cause he isnt even trying to repair my ps4 .... if anyoneâ€™s faced a similar issue please help me ... I dont wanna give up on my console when great games like lou2 and ghost of tsuchima are about to come
