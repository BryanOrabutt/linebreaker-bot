I’m new to reddit so I’d like to say hello first off , lemme get to the story basically I meet this girl freshman year of high school I never talked a girl or even try to start a conversation with on but some in my body told she the one so I decided to assume her origins / where  I think she form thinking I had a spot on guess but I was wrong but she didn’t even seem bothered that became a friendship that lasted about 2 years I’m a half and we almost did everything together then as we grew apart I found out she was dating someone else a part of my heart felt off and like the dumb person I was I ended the friendship because at the time I did not even know I was in love or quote on quote caught feelings. I didn’t realize until one of my old fiends said bro I swear you caught feeling and after he explained it I realized we was right , I want to clarify some thou I wasn’t mad at the boyfriend we was cool I was just sad out friendship after all that time I put in I left everything for her, after using videogame to get over it and officially stop having day dreams of us having kids and being happy I go into a group chat she was in for a while ago to retrieve a picture of my friend a she asked what it was I said a pic of one of my buddy’s because we had like old bad and good memories in it, then she asked how I was and said if I could hang out with her and one of our other og friends I said no Nicely but she really wanted me two so I said yes lemme know when so I could get it over with and not look like a jackass acting like I haven’t prayed  for this for a while, basically I put it on her to step it up so it wouldn’t happen but it did and it was nice , and the feelings I had rekindled hers my question reddit should I go for or move on and be stronger
