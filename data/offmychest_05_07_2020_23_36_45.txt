Im 23 and a female. Lately I have been trying to make friends. My best option is through the internet. I just moved and I haven't made any friends irl. I am in school but the type of school it is makes it hard because I dont happen to click with anyone which is fine, it happens. Nothing wrong with that. However, I play lots of games and some are multiplayer so I thought  I would attempt to make some more serious online friends. Ive made several posts on Reddit to do so and I get the requests coming in. However the people I add end up just...disappearing. I make it clear in my post what Im looking for and at first they are fine with it. I also inform them that Im a sarcastic person and rather blunt. They always say thats fine and they are the same way. And great we hit it off. We talk and honestly everything seems good, like normal. Nothing weird happens but then they just stop talking. They either remove me from everything and say nothing or they just kinda ignore me. I first just thought it was because maybe I wasnt being clear but I would try different things and I kinda end up with the same result. To clarify, I am not being rude (at least I dont think I am)  and I make sure I respect personal boundaries. You might think but what if she really isnt. And that may be true but when it comes to questions or jokes I always let them kinda give the ok to make sure I avoid problems. I guess Im just kinda hurt because no one tells me what I did wrong so I cant fix it and I end up just sitting here feeling awkward because I put time and effort into a potential friendship just to get dropped. And I know online friendships are hard but for this to happen all the time makes me feel like Im the one with the problem. It also doesn't help I have no one to talk to in the start. So when this stuff does happen Im literally alone. I only have myself to go to.  I really dont know what Im looking for in advice. I guess maybe suggestions?
