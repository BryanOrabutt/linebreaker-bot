I was about 10... My friends (including my crush) and I were swimming in the pool while my dad was at the side of the house building a walkway. Suddenly, I felt a little pressure and I knew I had to drop a phat stack.  I got out of the pool and booked it inside to use the washroom, only to find my crush was already in there. I panicked because the only other washroom was in the basement and it was terrifying down there so I certainly wasnt going to use that one, but this turd was coming and I needed to move fast.  My closest and most private option was the garage.  I ran in there, frantically pulled off my one piece, squatted, and did my business, all while being on high alert to hear if my dad was coming (he was literally working right outside the door).  Thankfully I finished without getting caught but now I was standing in the garage with a log sitting right in the middle of it.  I had to figure out what to do and quick before anyone saw.  I opened the door to the backyard a smidge and saw that my dad had gone inside for a minute. Not even 2 meters away was the door my crush would be walking out of when he was done in the washroom.  I had to make a snap decision so I quickly grabbed my poo and placed it on the powdery gravel my dad had just laid down. I found some sticks and madly flattened it out and covered it in gravel so it was camouflaged before either my crush or my dad walked out.  When I was satisfied with my work I ran back to the pool and jumped in like nothing happened. Shortly after my crush joined back in and soon after that my dad came outside and continued on the walkway. He proceeded to lay down sand, place the stone tiles, and cement it all up.  I've never told anyone that my turd is preserved under that walkway... so many people have stepped there now and it's this silly little inside joke I have with myself when I see people walk over it.
