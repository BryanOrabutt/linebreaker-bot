Me and MF went to our local mall and the whole freaking time K is following us we didn't think any thing of it until this happens.                                                                                           Me and MF walked into GameStop and I just turned 18           (I look 15)so I go and pick out RE2 (resident evil 2 remake) and and Naruto and deku action figures I get up to the counter.
