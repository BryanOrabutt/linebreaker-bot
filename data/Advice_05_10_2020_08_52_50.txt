20 year old Male here. My question is about being happy. Majority of the time I am stuck up in work life and trying to be the best I can. I know that’s life an that i am probably in for more of a shock. But over the last year and a bit I have realised so much about myself and other people. I am never happy despite all the hard work I do with my career and on myself. I know it’s not normal to always be happy but I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy. Maybe when I was 12-13? Aside from that my life has been up an down. When ever people see me they say I have nothing to be sad about. I wish they knew what went on in my head. I am sick of being by own worst enemy but I can’t stop it. I have days where I am fine and in a good mindset then other days I just feel like ending it all. I live a healthy clean life and get lot of exercise. I am not chasing unnatural highs or anything that’s going to make me feel good. I just want to be comfortable in my own skin and be content not so much happy, I am constantly stressed about what I have to do next. I haven’t been relaxed for over 4 years. My sleep isn’t to bad but it could be better. I don’t know what’s causing this though. Maybe it’s because I’ve never had a girlfriend? Or maybe it’s because I feel like majority of people I come across don’t like me. I’m not quiet sure why but I know right now I am not happy. But I also know I am doing everything in my power to be. I don’t know what more I can do. This negative vibe has surrounded me since I was 15-16 it’s starting to kill me. Could it be the way I look? Or the way I am approaching things? Over all in a nice guy. I’m not a saint but I’m genuine and I feel sympathy for others. Maybe I’m being to entitled or expecting to much? But I’m doing damage to myself and ruining opportunities by this way of thinking. Like I said I have good lifestyle though I think it’s just all in my head. It’s so hard to change though! I’m sick of feeling this way!!
