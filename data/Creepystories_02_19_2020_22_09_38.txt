So, just some backstory, there was this weird thing in my town a few years back were supposedly a black van was going around and trying to take children who were playing. I obviously thought this was bullshit and totally forgot about it . Anyway I was about 10 at the time and myself and 2 friends went on a boat trip with my mom and her friend. We got back from the trip and my mom ran into a friend of hers and they spoke for a few minutes . Us being 10 year old boys just ran back to the car and fucked around for a bit. We quickly realized the doors of the car were locked so we decided to sit down on a small bench overlooking the harbour. After about 2 or 3 minutes, I noticed a man was looking at us from a pathway/bridge type of thing raised above the ground (hard to explain) . I tilted my head and look back at him and he looked down. I noticed he was asian which was unusual for the area I live. Then, he took out his camera and began to take pictures of us and that creeped me out so i told my friends next to me . They noticed it too and we got kind of freaked out. Then as we all looked at him he gave us the creepiest wave imaginable. He signalled for us to come up to the bridge and took more pictures.  This was obviously really weird but we just laughed about it because of our fucked up sense of humor (Irish). The man stayed there and watched us for what seemed like hours but was more like a few minutes. We stayed seated . Eventually my mom came back and we got into the car . I immediately told her what happened and my friends backed me up. My mom thought we were joking and basically laughed at us and told us to shut up. Lovely. We drove up around the corner as that was the way home and I saw none other than the black van pull out from the direction the man was. Sent chills down my spine but it's a fun story at parties .
