Good evening everyone, I am in a need to rant out a few stuff before calming down. So, my mom has been "hiding" from a lot of people due to the huge amount of debt that she had accumulated within the years, for various reasons, and is usually paid off by my dad. I love my mom and know the hardships she goes into trying to get things right, but her past just keeps on biting on her and etc. It hurts to see how my dad has to always deal with this even though they are divorced as I have noted she has been hiding. I can get a hold of her, but I chose not to tell anyone that cause...I just can't. She is my mother.  Today another person somehow find my social media and got in contact with me asking to speak with my dad. I messaged my mom asking if she knows this person and she told me to block him on my and just in case on my dad's too. I feel bad always having to hide this from my dad but he doesn't need more stress. He is almost 50 and white hair is already in his dark brown hair. So I guess I am just ranting to the world, I am trying to 'protect' my family member, but in fact, I might be hurting them. You see I am not an outdoor person and I really dislike talking to people, but I always asked myself if I just suck it up and go out and make some actual earning I might even help my dad out. Then maybe I can help pay off some of my mother's debt and you know...try to make things good I guess? I tired of having to lie to family members and hide from people who are looking for my mom. And the people who want my mom just so happens to not be the kind type of people...Live is such a beautiful joke. If life insurance covers my death I would be much happier, but as of right now me alive might do my family a bit more of a good then bad....another day another earning. The world is so big, and yet you see the most ugliest things around you. I am 20 btw...not that I need to say this lol. Thank you for letting me rant to you people.
