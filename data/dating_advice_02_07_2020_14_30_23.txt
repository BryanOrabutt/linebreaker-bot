I (19f) have been talking to a guy I met on tinder for the last 3 weeks. I know I know tinder=not good idea but I’ve been having trouble meeting guys at my university so I tried tinder. Anyways, I matched with this guy and we instantly hit it off, have a lot in common and is easy to talk to. He’s been super sweet to me, always complimenting me, saying he wants to meet me, kiss, etc. But he’s never really put in effort in planning when to meet up. We live about 16 miles away from each other and have pretty complicated schedules but he’s said the distance isn’t a problem and I think there’s always a way to make time for someone if you really want to. It’ll typically go like this: he’ll say he wants to meet me, I ask when and say we should plan something, we’ll find a day that works for both of us, then the day comes and he doesn’t mention meeting up at all. I’m getting frustrated because I really like him and want a relationship with him but I’m starting to get suspicious and confused over his true intentions. He’s never asked for nudes, asked to hook up, etc so I don’t think he’s just looking for fwb or one night stands but at the same time I’m pretty sure he might be talking to many other girls. About a week ago his profile disappeared on tinder so idk if he I unmatched me or deleted it. So now I’m confused about what he actually wants from me. How can I talk to him about this? I want to know what his intentions are before I get more attached and hurt. I have 0 dating experience so I don’t know how to even bring this up or word it. I’m scared of losing this opportunity because this is the first time in a very long time that I’ve found someone I connected with and am attracted to. Other than him i haven’t really found anyone else on tinder that I really like. Am I being too impatient and should I wait a bit more to see where it goes or what should I do? We talked about meeting this Sunday but didn’t set a time or place, should I mention it again?
