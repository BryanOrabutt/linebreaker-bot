So I liked this girl for like a year (still do) I told her I liked her when I was drunk like 4 months ago. That’s when we started talking a little bit more. But we still had practically no contact apart from the occasional look from across the classroom. But a month ago we went to a party. I was drunk she wasn’t she doesn’t really like it when I drink but when I stared getting less and less drunk we just relaxed on the bed for 2 hours with her head on my shoulder the entire time. That’s when we started texting and sending pictures and such. But the day after she told my friend she just wanted to be friends. Which I found out today. But that’s the confusing part she always asks the teacher if I can sit with her in math class. We get a private room because we both blow ass in math. In the the break we sit on a couch and she is always all over me. With her legs over mine we also hold each other’s hands a little awkwardly for example she takes my hand says “wow your hands are much bigger than mine” than just holds my hand for a few minutes. She asked me if I just liked her or “loved” her I said I loved her then she sent this string of emojis 😊🤭❤️. We always talk about having a movie marathon together. She is usually the one that brings it up. I always say she can come whenever she wants. She says she will come over when she comes home from her vacation. So that’s pretty nice. But we had a small argument about a week ago about my snusing habits which is basically a small package of nicotine you put in your lip. It is basically the same as smokes but with out the lung cancer and the awful smell. She said if I ever did it she would never be my friend again. Of course my friends told me to tell her because she would find out eventually so I told her. She said we could still be friends and that she was joking. But she was mad at me so I told her I’ll give her space. Which she didn’t want but I said I didn’t wanna talk if your just gonna send pictures of your roof that’s when she said OKAY I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. Which practically reverted everything to normal. And we started talking 24/7 again. So do you guys think she still likes me or not?
