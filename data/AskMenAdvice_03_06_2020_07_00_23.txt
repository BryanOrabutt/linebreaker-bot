So right off the bat I know this is my own problem and I really want it to go away, so I was in my first relationship last to last year which went on for a year and a half, I'm 22 right now, it ended for unrelated reasons but my retroactive jealousy took a bad toll on it, just because she was my first everything but she had two boyfriends before me I gave her a bad time, I feel really guilty about it but this still kinda persists in me. So I'm an old school romantic with what I'd like to think with a good moral compass, I don't agressively hit on girls, I'm just not into hooking up with someone if no emotions are involved, I've never done, I'm not saying this makes me better than the rest but in this day and age it just kinda makes me... Different? And I kinda wish I wasn't this way. Then I meet a great girl while travelling, she's Turkish so quite European in her mindset while I'm an archaic Asian in my thinking I guess :/, she's only the second person I've been intimate with and I really like her, my friend told me that she was sharing some of her experiences with him and she told him she got drunk and slept with her best friend once, that just put her down in my eyes a bit? I know this doesn't make her any less of the wonderful girl I am into, it just makes me weird and I realize that, my brain just thinks weird things like she doesn't value sex, the best friend probably feels like such a king since he probably fancied her since the beginning and then she fucked him, all retarded thoughts, I guess I just subconsciously want to hold every woman to my standards, which is only being intimate with someone if you have feelings for them, which I get is unfair but everyone has a right to their standards, but this will cost me a great deal, i may miss out on extremely wonderful and compatible women, and might meet one with the same ideals and me but she could be boring as fuck, how do I get over this guys? :(, Note : I'm not gonna date the Turkish girl since we live in different continents, so she's not gonna get hurt because of my stupidity, but we're still in constant contact and I just want to improve myself since I spotted my bad thinking pattern when I was exposed to that information.
