Myself (f27) and my fiancé (m33) have been together for 3.5 years and have recently moved to a new city together 3 hours from my hometown. We rent a 2 bedroom townhome with a spare bedroom for when my family wants to come visit. 1 month ago his mother decided she wants to stay with us even though she owns her own home a hour away. She goes home one day a week to check on her home and then returns the following day.                                                                    The issue with this is pretty obvious. She’s very invasive and has no regard for our wishes. She’s stated she does this with other relatives in regards to showing up invited because “that’s what family does” my fiancé enjoys her staying because she’s constantly baking treats, does the laundry and other household chores.                                                                            We recently found out we’re expecting our first child together. She told both of us we’ll need to move into a 3 bedroom when the lease is up to be able to accommodate the baby. She does not help with the rent or anything I might add. And I don’t want to pay higher rent when we have all the space we need. I also invited her to be in the delivery room since it’s her first grandchild and I’ve been trying to have a positive attitude and she told me that “regardless of what I wanted she would be in there.”                                         I’ve talked to my fiancée and he said he would talk to her but he won’t tell her not stay with us because we should be appreciative of all of her help. My sister is going to visit in March and now has to sleep on a air mattress in the living room because the spare bedroom is now the mother in laws.                                 I’ve fallen into such a deep depression over the lack of control and comfort I have in my own home that I just sleep all day to avoid being around her. I’ve been considering getting a abortion and calling off the wedding even though I deeply love my fiancé because I can’t live like this. My fiancé insists that’s it’s my hormones which might be adding to it but I just feel hopeless in the situation.                                                     I grew up with my grandmother on a low income and have lived on my own and been financially dependent since I was 18 so I’m wondering if maybe that’s why I’m having trouble adjusting to being bossed around because I feel like I should be more appreciative of the help since my fiancé and me both work and go to school full time and some aspects are nice but I can’t help but feeling resentful.                                                   If I don’t end up leaving, I’m moving back to my hometown when the lease is up this summer with or without my fiancé since it’s far enough away from her that she won’t stay. We lived together for 2 years prior to moving her and she wasn’t a issue before we moved. I guess I just gave myself my own answer I just needed somewhere to rant. If you read all of this, thank you for listening.
