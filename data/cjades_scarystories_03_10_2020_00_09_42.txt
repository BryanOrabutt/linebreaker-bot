Hi, my name is serenity and I live in a small town Moreno Valley, Nothing really happens here the only thing scary is that there an old schoolhouse one street away the story is that a man took all the kids and killed them in a shaded. Anyways my house is one of the old houses in my town. so around Easter stuff always happens my mom heard foot steeps and the doorbell rang and no one was there than my cousin was doing the dog filter on snap chat and a face popped up 4 times in 4 different spots also I always fell like someone is watching me. Oh My God, I almost forgot my cousins saw a girl with black hair sticks her head out of my room by everyone was in the living room with them. And when my aunt was little she played with the ouija board outside of my cousin's room. also well I was typing this in my room alone I heard someone sit on my bed (my bed makes noise when someone sits on it) so something scary happened to me and my cousin I didn't know that it was scary when this happened I found out on Saturday.anyways on Thanksgiving I spent the night at my aunts and uncles. It was like 2 or 3 in the morning and I was the only one awake but I heard footsteps and thought it was my uncle so I never said anything. But the same thing happened to my cousin be he looked out the door and saw that no one there so he scream for his parents(my cousins room is directedly cross from the room I spent the night in) anyway when he told me about this I told them what happened to me at their house but my uncle said he went to sleep at 1 on Thanksgiving so I'm scared to go to their house now. Its been a year later and I spent the night at there house on Thanksgiving again but I can never really fall asleep at there house so it was like 2 or 3 again and I was laying in the living room next to my 6-year-old cousin trying to go to sleep when I heard a voice come from the bathroom saying stop it sounded like a girl child but everyone was asleep and I could see directly into the bathroom from where I was in the living room and no it wasn't my little cousin cause after I checked if he was sleeping and it didn't sound like his voice or anyone in the house.
