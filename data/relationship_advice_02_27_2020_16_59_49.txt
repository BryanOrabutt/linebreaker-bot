My wife hit me with she thinks shes bisexual and wants to give it a try! Now most guys (NOT ALL) would probably jump at the chance of it. We are happily married and she has gave little hints before of, that girls hot i would totally do her, and such. Im not one to say what you can and cant do. We are married and i hold that to the core, i would do anything for my wife take a bullet whatever I'm having a hard time accepting this fact. Not bc i find it disgusting or anything but the drama that I've seen couples go through. I have told my wife time and time again that i dont want anyone else, then jason aldean makes a song got what i got thats now her ringtone! We are both very jealous people when it comes to being around the opposite sex. She said its something she really wants to try, im the type of person to keep things fantasies, dont get me wrong most every guys dream is a threesome but i feel shes trying to use that as an excuse to experiment. Part of me wants to say absolutely not, then the other part kind of wants this fantasy to come true, but i dont want to risk 1 night of fun to throw away our life together. Our relationship is solid. We are the best of friends and help others we barely know. Why am i having such a hard time thinking about this. I hold our marriage sacred and would go above and beyond for my family, i dont wanna risk 1 night to lose my wife. I deal with insecurities and cant stand the thought of anoyher persom male/female with my wife, we dont talk about our past encounters, or atleast in front of each other bc it bothers us both about each others past, she says she wants to try it and then bring girl in for a threesome. Honestly i cherish our marriage more than just a random thing. I honestly dont know what to do, we have talked set ground rules as if this was to happen. On 1 hand i want her to do it and hoping a threesome, the other hand i feel theres too much drama......
