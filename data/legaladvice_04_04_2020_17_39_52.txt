So this all started a couple years ago. I am a 19 year old roleplayer from NC, but when I was 17 I started a roleplay with someone that lasted until I was 18 (going on 19). We roleplayed as characters from one of the shows we both watched, and since the show was rated M, I didn’t think anything of it. Also, the platform we used to roleplay shows you how long a person was on it, and since you had to be 13 to join, I did the math and it showed that the person was no more than a year younger than me, if they signed up the day they turned 13. Due to this, the rating of the show we roleplayed characters from, and the age of consent in my state (16) I didn’t think about asking them of their age or location, since I didn’t want to make them uncomfortable and all the signs pointed to them being close enough to my age for a close in age exemption. Well, we roleplayed a lot and at times it got a bit erotic, nothing worse than fifty shades of grey, but still explicit. We also never really spoke out of the roleplay, and never directed any conversation to each other unless it was about ideas for our story. Well, later on I got a little suspicious about their age and I decided to look them up and after quite a bit of digger, I found out they were younger than they seemed to be. I got scared and immediately ended our stories and my anxiety went into full panic mode. Would this be enough for me to be charged under 18 UCS 2422 or any other federal law? We never spoke out of the story and I’m not sure where this person is from. But, we are close enough in age that if we did have sexual contact in my state (NC), it would not be illegal. How does me being a minor when this started play into any laws? Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’ve been living with this for months and I’m scared shitless. My mental health is deteriorating and I just want to put this behind me. Thank you.
