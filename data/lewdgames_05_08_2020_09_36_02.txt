Hello guys, I am new in game dev, more precisely I am at my 2nd project while learning Godot an open source game engine and 3D CG with Blender. I wanted to see my improvements so I made a “Megaman-like” hentai-action-platformer game (because the megaman zero series are one of my favorite game): “Cyber Girl 1.0 Blazing Revenge”. A very simple game which is more of an action-platformer than hentai, don’t expect beautiful arts, cgs, or good H-scenes... (I suck at them, did I mention being an amateur), however I tried to compensate that with something else. Here is a link to the alpha version (please read until the end if you are interested before downloading): \[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1suQ-vK9S5NaovUaBeYQ9gAKlq8oLTdIu](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1suQ-vK9S5NaovUaBeYQ9gAKlq8oLTdIu)\]. All of my characters design are inspired from Yakou’s art (Yakou 4507770), especially cyborgs (not the gore, my game is 1000 times “gore-less” than Angel Heart), some may think his arts are sometimes “disturbing” so here is a link to some samples: \[[https://e-hentai.org/g/1372271/2845285317/](https://e-hentai.org/g/1372271/2845285317/)\] and judge for yourself (the cyborgs one at least). If it’s fine, let’s continue! Here are the system requirements:  Windows 7/8/10 only ; RAM: 1Go can run it HOWEVER some lagging will occur (if it happens or some non-responsive commands, try to re-run the application again), at least 2Go is recommended for the RAM though; VRAM: at least 1Go is recommended (if not continue reading), ALSO make sure your PC support OpenGL3 (if you try to run the application and some message appears like “not supported blablabla”, try to update your Graphic cards drivers to its latest version if possible, and if it still don’t work or drivers can’t be updated OR your VRAM is 512 Mo and NOT LESS, download the game with this link: \[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q6pNmKJqWKMtGjOflutzVbtMtc2o2Z3U](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q6pNmKJqWKMtGjOflutzVbtMtc2o2Z3U)\] HOWEVER the game may behave strangely AND some particle effects won’t render, if the application still not working, it may comes from incompatible drivers/hardware…). Wow, that was long! But thanks for sticking to the end, if you find any issues, you can report it here however I can’t respond right way due to some problems with my PC but I will try to respond to all of your questions ASAP. English is not my country’s first language, it’s not even the second so sorry for any misspelling or such (yeah google translate won’t do). Thank you very much for your time.
