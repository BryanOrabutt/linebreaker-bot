(Long) So I work for a popular pizza chain. I have been working for this particular company for over a year, and was pretty well known by all the managers and my boss as one of the hardest workers, and one of the few that could handle every kitchen position and register on their own. Recently, I requested to be put on standby since I was going to University in another state. Boss said this was fine, just call over breaks for some hours while I’m home. I told him I definitely would, and the crew sent me off with a few gifts and I told them I was excited to come back for the holidays. I found out a short time before I left that my boss had to resign on relatively short notice due to personal reasons, but my close friend told me the new boss was pretty good too so I didn’t mind. Fast forward to winter break. I get home, and call the pizza place so I can make some extra holiday money. New boss picks up (hasn’t met me yet) and informs me that “they don’t have any shift openings, so call back in the summer.” I knew for a fact that the holidays were insane at this particular store, but he clearly wasn’t budging so I just said “ok” and hung up. The next day, I went to the restaurant that was in my town, and discovered that one of the managers that I knew well had been transferred there. I chatted with him a bit, and the next day, my transfer was pending. When the managers at my store saw this, the messages began. “Why are you transferring?” “We could really use you here.” I simply replied with “Ask New Boss.” I found out from one of the managers that was at my new store on a supply run that the kitchen at my original store had been going through hell, since several people walked out, and the holidays were already hellish with a full staff. My new job, may I add, is much easier since the new store isn’t as popular as the old one. Still making the same amount of pay, and my boss at this store told me to come back this summer.
