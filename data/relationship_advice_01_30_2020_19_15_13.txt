On Christmas Eve my gf left to Serbia for two months to visit her family, we'd message everyday and always video chat for at least a good 20 minutes or so everyday, everything was going fine, we'd always talk about how we couldn't wait to see each other and how we'd both been thinking about the moment we'd get to finally hold each other again, she's got anxiety/depression and also BPD so she has her moments of dissociating and needing to be alone, I told her I can handle that and that I'm willing to give her all the space she needs, I just would like to be filled in when she does so that I'm not left wondering what's going on, if she made it home safe from places, etc. This girl loves me, there's no doubt in my mind, and she does want to stay with me, but out of the blue a few days ago she breaks everything of, and tells me that I need to move on, first she starts by telling me that she doesn't feel the same way which I know is totally untrue, she later even admitted after I asked her that she does still love and care for me, but that she knows what'll be best for us in the long run, she feels that ending it now will save either one or both of us the hurt later, she's got huge abandonment issues because of past relationships, so I honestly get where she is coming from, but I know for a FACT that she does want to stay with me, she's just terrified that I'll walk out on her later because she feels she can't give her all to a relationship because she's unable to trust 100%, I told her that I would stick around no matter how long it took me to convince her that I'd stay, she warned me that it could take years and I said that I didn't care, I'd do anything for her, and I honestly would, the problem is she's convinced herself that she doesn't deserve me, and that she never will, so she thinks she's better off alone. I really don't know what to do, I want to talk to her when she gets back home and just try to convince her that we're genuinely better off together but I'm not feeling confident that I'm going to be able to.... I fucking cannot lose this girl, we have literally everything in common, we think the same thing at the same time and finish each other's sentences for goodness sake, even when we're messaging while we're thousands of miles apart we'll type the same thing at the same time. I seriously do not have it in me to lose this girl. Sorry for the rant, thank you in advance.
