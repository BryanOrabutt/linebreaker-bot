Hi, i’ve never posted on reddit before but i have a question that no one around can relate to or answer for me in my life so i’m turning to you guys (i apologize for my poor writing skills in advance). So i’ll just get straight into it i’m kinda not new to smoking i’ve been doing this for like a year and a half now but still one or two hits get me at a perfect high but every time i go over i experience “greening out”, that’s the best way i can explain it because every time i mention it to my friends they say their green out experiences are different. My “green outs” are super intense and i remember every single moment of it, when it first starts i go on like a trip where i’m perfectly conscious from someone else’s view looking at me but everything goes in to this weird warped world where pictures that aren’t even in real life or in my surroundings are distorted and unsettlingly bursting out at me or my whole “world” is swirling, i use the parentheses because it’s not even the actual world around me it’s colours i can’t even remember even though every other detail is clear to me now writing this and scary distorted shapes or faces and i lose all ability to communicate or move unless i try really hard. But once the “trip stage” wears out i’m left with another torturing experience the physical aspect of it is kind of painful, like my teeth get super sensitive and taste grossly sweet (ik it sounds weird but the taste of my teeth turn really sweet in contact of my tongue), my mouth starts to tastes absolutely disgusting and dry to the point of inability to speak and my whole body tingles in slightly painful waves moving from the top of my head to bottom (almost like a mix of static leg/ when your limbs fall asleep and stomach butterflies). Getting into mentally it’s like i’m trapped in my freaking body/ mind, my motives are not warped i think pretty rationally but everything slows down and when i try to speak it comes out differently than what i think instead all incoherent mumbles. My vision gets like in a shifted glitchy blur almost like a head rush from nicotine but way way worse, i lose control of my body and muscle and everything becomes limp and unconscious when my mind is fully conscious and unable to control my body or my own eyelids. Idk about you guys but my green outs are like absolute hell and torture for me in a serious sense. At this point idk even know if that perfect high is worth the green outs at this point. Thanks for letting me and vent and please give me feedback if anyone else experiences this too.
