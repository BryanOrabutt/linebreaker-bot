First let me set the backstory, I’ve been talking to a girl from a small town near me for about a week we met on tinder and one day she texts me to come over(we are both 18) well on the way to this small town like 15 mins away I get pulled over on a dark AF and empty road going 10 over the speed limit the officer gives me my ticket I apologize and said it wouldn’t happen again well behold the second I go into this small town a new cop is tailing me so I turn down a different street to kinda lose him (I know it’s stupid but his brights being on the entire time was ticking me off) so for about 10 mins for me to find this girls house I park in the back alley, and sneak into her room (she lives separated from the house of her parents) NOT EVEN 20 mins go by we hear a pounding on her door so I dip and hide in the closet well turns out a officer saw my truck in the alley and saw me go into the separated building and thought it seemed suspicious so he goes and knocks on the main house door and tells the parents so long story short I get kicked out I’m ticked off I have a ticket and just got yelled at by the parents I see the cop leaving he says nothing to me while he pulls out so I just say fuck it and go home but on my way out of the town I was tailed yet again until I left the town but not even a couple miles a new car appears behind me I’m going 60 in a 70 just Because I knew the other cop was going be ahead in this dark ass road and that’s when his lights get flashed and I get pulled over again for to dim of a license plate light  and I told the cop sir I’ve already been stop given a ticket can I pls go home he then said can I see your license and insurance so we go through the whole ordeal again and he gave me a warning about the license plate light so anyway there’s the story on how I got a ticket,yelled at parents, and stopped again honestly this feels like police harassment and I was wondering is it?
