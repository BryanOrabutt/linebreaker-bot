Until I started spending time with other dads. I had no idea you guys existed. It sounds weird but I honestly don’t even know what I thought a dad was or did. Dads aren’t really even in movies, not in ones that I’ve seen anyway, except maybe a two second cameo where they’re holding a beer in front of a bbq. I didn’t think I was missing much. Cardboard cut out that grills you turkey. Weird. Ok. But my friend had a baby recently and her dad was with us and I was so scared and uncomfortable around him until I saw how she was around him. She treated him like she treats me, she told him everything and went to him when she wanted to be comforted. I could tell he was her safety and it was baffling. He was so funny and helpful and supportive and she was so comfortable around him. She was completely herself and I could tell he loved her. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve never been more envious of anything in my life. He said things to lift her up and my mind was blown. A lot of dads have been around lately for some reason, and I guess they’re this person who says things to encourage you, a person you can call in the middle of the night if you’re scared or to help you fix your car (something else I thought was just in the movies). Like a friend, but better. My dad is a really violent acquaintance and whenever I leave seeing him, I feel so bad about myself I want to die. I had no idea what I was missing until recently and I’m so jealous. I’m not a jealous person but I’m overwhelmed with sadness and envy and wishing I had a person like this in my life. I didn’t know that character description ever existed- like seeing a new color for the first time- and now that I know it, I want it so much and there’s no way for me to get it. I guess I don’t mean anything by putting this here but just found this r/ and it’s another example of dads. It’s really incredible. I’ve cried a few times just reading your guys’ stuff. It’s unreal to me.
