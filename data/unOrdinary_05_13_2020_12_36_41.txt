Ok... I know that I'm gonna get shit on for saying this but this has been a long time coming and after reading some posts here and there I feel as if I needed to say this to get the idea across that some of your mentalities/ generally the way you think is so fragile and honestly it makes me think that most of you haven't dealt with the hardships of life and secondly how you guys blatantly choose the side of ignorance over what's there in the story. And umm, this has to do with John and the way he acts the reason why he does the things he do. Let me get this out of way, **I DO NOT ENJOY SEEING JOHN** put people in the hospital and thats not cool(in a general sense), and this is by no means one of the main arguments that people use to shit on John as a person. But let me just say this, do people inside and outside of the story **forget that John was passive for 2 whole years?**( with the type of POWER that he wields) and that he NEVER wanted any of this AT ALL. People.... oh my goodness shit on him for fighting back and for going in hard and I say **who cares** if actions like arlos ( a guy who SPENT AN ENTIRE MONTH orchestrating the destruction of ONE persons life can be over looked by **everyone!**) then John pushing back after being fed up with that and to two years of torment from everyone around him shouldn't be something that people should use to ridicule him AT ALL. Oh my goodness, and to the pricks that rebuttal to the people that defend him(and shit on characters like arlo) most commonly say " **oH tHE PeOple DefeNding hiM aRe edgy teenagers**" what?! Huh thats so weak and so lame as a counter argument. OK I'm 19 and soon I'm about to turn 20 but what does that have to do with anything and using age to attack someone for defending him is so **pathetic**, **some** of johns actions are justifiable. And it not us being edgy its us **understanding how the world works** when you  are pushed over and over and over again for doing nothing wrong than you're gonna wanna push back to, pushing back HARD! thats just how the world works. And what's even more disturbing is that people say that John is worse off than arlo and that arlo has **developed** as a person and as a character, which NO he hasn't and if anything he only got humbled a **little** (and thats me being generous) and thats only because John whooped his ass. He's still a hypocrite, self entitled arrogant little prick and I can go as far as to say that since second season he hasn't **MADE any attempts to fix the shit that he started** and he's developed? He contributed a great deal into Seraphinas ability loss, ruined! John and seraphinas relationship and forced the responsibility of calming John down to her and her alone( even though its HIS FAULT that they are both in the crappy situation that they are in now) and thanks to his STUPID obsession with the status quo his friends, and his School all got fucked up. Where is he at? what has he done to try to fix this mess that he started? where is his development? its non existence and yet people choose him over John like its not even a debate and defend him more than they do John. Man sorry for writing this much but I really needed to get this out..... aw man this is getting ridiculous are people willing choosing to be ignorant  or do they just have a weak way of thinking?
