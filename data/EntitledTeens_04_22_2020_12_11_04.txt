I have a brother and he's 15 and he is so entitled whenever he doesnt get what he wants he throws a fit and says why everytime and i forgot to aslo add that he beats me up everytime i choose to not be his slave(or say no lol) he bullies me nonstop and same as the people that i hqvent done anything to them do the same. And at one point he and the people nearly broke me into depression for 3 years so this was when i was 10 and now im 13,but thats not the story here.the bullies and my brother would taunt me because i was a 'Momma's boy" and well they got karma in their own special way. I was the smartest kid in my English class so thats technically why they bully me nonstop.One of the bullies turned out to be my own friend (i've been there since day one for him)and he just lets me go like a broken toy.i cant believe that,anyways my brother got his deserved karma.It was a regular day and i was playing on my xbox and i was about to set a new world record for defeating the games hardest boss(moonlord that is) and this guy just yanks my controller and lets me die(my world record character was on hardcore and thats what made me really hard and mad and then he has the audacity to say "well its your fault you are bad at this game" i was so mad i literraly shouted what the fuck dude! So then my paremts came upstairs and asked me what the matter is and this dude just acts like a 5 year old child and says"he tried to bite me and told me to fuck off in the middle of my game". And tgey turned to me and i said your game you just caused me a damn near stroke because i was about to get a world record and be in the books(thats what i think happens when you beat a wolrd record) and i've just lost all my stuff without getting it back and same as the chracter you duffus. My parents ground us both because i shouted what the fuck and my brother because well.you know what he did  i just wish i was strong enough to bully him and ask him how it feels like.damn i hate my older brother can't wait till he moves out ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
