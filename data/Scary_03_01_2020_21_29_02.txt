Where I last left off I was talking about how I decided to reply to the guys messages to let him now he's got the wrong account I first replied with a simple hey you have the wrong person sorry I thought maybe he would take the hint and leave me alone but he didn't instead he started messaging more but this time it was like more normal conversations he did stop with the "I love you" messages and started just saying "hi how are you" or "wyd" after a while I started messaging him back with a "hi" when he would say hi or when he asked what I was doing I would just reply "nothing" it was like simple two word sentences and that's it but then he started saying stuff like "let's meet up" I got weirded out and tried to ignore it but then he would send me snaps and when I opened them they were pictures or videos of him walking late at night in the streets now I live in LA so most people tend to stay off the streets at 9-10 p.m because after that you see more gang members, weirdos, and homeless people wandering the streets and it gets pretty dangerous so the first thing that came to mind was this guy is crazy or he's a part of a gang or something which made me second guess replying to his texts because I don't want to be affiliated with gang members. After that I started realizing a couple even more weird things here and there he would send some videos of him walking down a street that looked very familiar to me and when I found out why my stomach dropped. It looked familiar because it was a street that was one or two blocks away from my house this gave me the creeps and I told my friends about it and how I was getting scared that's when I found out about the Snapchat location map thing and turns out my location was on I remember the app asking for my location when I first got the app but I thought it was just for the filters you can add to a picture where it says your time and the city or place your in this made me really scared and I turned it off immediately but I guess it was too late he already knew my location because the next day he sent a video of him on a bus I was assuming it was the "605" or something because it passes directly in front of my house and when he panned the camera up towards the bus window there it was my house and then the video ended. I got extremely scared because that is never a good thing. (I'll explain the next part later I just don't have a lot of time on my hands right now)
