So 9 am comes around. ON THE CLOCK. i even get the tweet so i head to the link only to see ‘TICKETS NOT AVAILABLE’ so im like yup sold out my only chance to see bladee since 2016 sbe concert but then for some reason i keep refreshing and finally to my surprise it lets me cop a ticket, im thinking this is a small window of opportunity,so im just filling out my info im ready to cop two tickets but for some reason I call my friend to tell him im copping for us then when i head back the page just refreshed and sent me back to ‘TICKETS NOT AVAILABLE’ and its just like that the rest of the time. at this point im already pissed by the fact i missed a miracle opportunity thats was against the odds. so me n my friend out of desperation look around for resellers trying to keep the budget under 100 after trying i come across someone who i thought was legit, he had proof and everything then we try and work things out but i get a gut feeling that this is too good to be true, so i stand by my ground and say to send the tix first before i send just to play it safe cause im the one with the money, if anything happens itd be my loss because even if i ‘scammed’ them they would loos $25 versus me losing nearly $100 so at the end of the day its just trusting people, anyways we come to terms in me sending half then they send the tix and i send other half. well what do u know as soon as i send the first half i get blocked. im just at a loss for words that this is what it came down to. other than the fact that there were bots i came to the realization that people probably secured their spots and decided to cop as many tickets as they can to resell. the last time i seen bladee was 2016 at the sbe concert which was when i was first introduced to him and after all this waiting i cant believe this is what happened. my only hope is that he’ll preform at yung leans tour since their shows are close together
