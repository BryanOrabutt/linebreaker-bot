So I came back from NYC and needed a uber back home at around 3 in the morning. My mom was with me so I ordered one on my phone and it was a young gentleman named I think Luis or something. (Also I live in a fairly large city and have taken many ubers with mostly normal drivers so I don’t think much of it) He arrived at the pick up lane and got out and popped the trunk to put our luggage in. He stood tall and seemed friendly even though he was wearing Jeffrey Dahmer glasses and he had one of those old man “flat cap” hats on (like the plaid ones) and he was bald but looked like he was around 25/26 years of age. We got in the uber and he started driving, but the way he drove was weird. He was hunched over, squinting, and drove like 15 miles below the speed limit. He asked my mom and I about our personal lives and jobs etc. and me trying to be friendly told him probably too much while trying to avoid awkward silence. The thing that was confusing me was the fact I thought he was so young but now he was acting like he was 80. When he would converse he would say like somewhat stereotypical old people things like “Back in my day” and “When I grew up we...” etc etc I cant really quote it but it was so staged. The creepiest part to me is he was actually ubering us straight to my house and my mom needed to use the bathroom so she jumped out and rushed toward my house when he dropped us off so I went to the trunk to go get our luggage and he hopped out to and stood tall and watched me smiling as I got the bags out. I was freaked out so I grabbed all the bags and quickly said thank you. When i got inside my house my mom and I were so freaked out. I don’t know why someone would pretend to be old or whatever he was trying to do so I have no idea was his intention was. This was only like a week ago and i’m still freaked out.
