A lot of people in the community hate blood only because 75% of the community loves mob so much and they’re blinded by there love for mob they consider blood a disappointment and we’d be better off it never existed but I think the blood is better than mob.so for a while they had a gap in ratings blood in d and mob in b but the more I think about it there are close to being tied or switched.mob is a fan favorite because the maps previously were considered bad by community and I agree and how unique it was and the theme and story were fantastic which I agree with the concept is good and was executed nicely and had a nice flow but both maps are kinda tedious but I see it most on mob and no I’m not complaining saying mobs difficult which it kind of is makes it a bad map because I enjoy the tedious and hard challenges,and I can already see it in the comments and also this is my opinion see don’t down and type ”fuck you mob is better than blood kys!” We can agree to disagree.and mob being a tad more complicated than blood I see a greater reward in blood having the magma gat a way better version of the acid gat and a shield that can get you out of sticky situations quickly,granted mob also has a shield but it can’t blast the zombies out of the way can it and the process is quick and easy so it’s super casual and so is mob but I think mob is in the middle in difficulty were blood leans more on the casual side making it enjoyable and adds replay ability value is a map you can hop on and have a great time.i love bloods story over mobs because mob is just “they wanna escape prison,there plan goes wrong,they kill al, and al kills the other guys and walks away a free man.” Where is on blood it’s “during there trip to the house they make a detour to Alcatraz where Richthofen discover the kronoruims pages changed and Richthofen comes to tears with his sacrifice and post-revelation Richthofen tells the others that doctor Monty is evil confused they later find out who he is Nikolai becomes the leader and the head on to the pentagon to gather the ultimus crew” yeah significantly better.
