This happened a few days ago and i cannot stop thinking about it. Before my mom went to bed she told me not to leave the key in the keyhole when i locked the door because my sister was coming later (she doesn't live with us). It was around 2:30am and i was still laying on the couch with my phone, paying attention to hear a car pulling over at my place cause it was kinda late and my sister was not here yet (she's 17). I hear the car and i recognize her voice, she told the person in the car to let them know when they arrived home, then she laughed, closed the door and then nothing. I live in a complex with 5 other apartments. I was listening to music and i stopped it to listen closely cause i didn't hear her opening the metal door downstairs or coming up (the stairs are metallic as well and you make quiet a noise when you come up) but there was just silence. I went downstairs, no one. I checked the street from the balcony and nothing. I messaged her asking at what time she would come and she didn't get it. At this point i was like nope I'm waking my mom up. I did and she told me that my sister would come early in the morning because she went out with a friend. I came back to the living room and she had replied, saying the same. That she was at her best friend's place and they were watching a movie. I told her what had just happened, and let me tell you that my sister is really sceptical and she wouldn't tell me what she did just to mess with me. She told me that a few minutes ago (aka when i heard her here) she went out of her friends place to say goodbye to her friend's sister who was going to a party. She told the girl "let me know when you arrive" to what the other replied "well what are you my mom now?" and then they both laughed. I SWEAR that i heard her downstairs I worried that much because i was 100% sure she had arrived. What are the chances of me listening to that conversation 2km away from it?
