So, I’ve been having scalp issues for years, and in about 7th grade I was (sorta) diagnosed with “Sebo-Psoriasis” which is kind of a mixture of seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis. I only saw the dermatologist who diagnosed me a few times, as I had been to a few other dermatologists and they didn’t know what was going on with my scalp. Anyway, the issue is that when I was in 4th grade (I’m in 10th now) I began picking my scalp and I developed a scab on the top of my head. It was the first time I’d ever had anything like this and holy shit I could NOT stop picking it for the life of me. The scab (including scarring and opening again) lasted for about three years on my scalp from my picking. I remember sitting in class and just picking it until my fingers were bloody, and it I always felt super embarrassed and shameful. I eventually had to get an injection into the irritated scar/scab where it actually went away within a few days even with my fatal attempts to pick at it again. By the time that one had gone I was already in 6/7th grade and of course, the middle school years were stressful, and I began picking again at the back of my head. In short, that scab lasted for another 3 years, and I still had it at the beginning of this school year and it has since disappeared. Unfortunately, less than a week ago I began picking at my scalp again near my ear and I’ve got another bloody scab that I can’t resist picking. I just really don’t want this to last for years again and I can’t find a distraction that works, because it just gets itchier and more compelling to pick. I have no doubt in my mind that I have some form of dermatillomania, because I don’t actually actively pick my healthy skin specifically to create a scab, but I do constantly search for scabs to pick and when something on my scalp is remotely itchy, I scratch it until it creates a scab, because it just seems to keep getting itchier? Well anyway, that’s all, I just needed to get that off my chest.
