Literally my whole life girls ignored me and literally wanted nothing to do with me and from the constant rejection from girls I developed low self esteem and BDD, you may be thinking that I am some emo or a freak of a person but I'm actually a normal guy, I was apart of the popular group in school. Any time I tried to talk to any girl she would would just ignore me and I just felt so bad about myself everytime this happened and this happened constantly. Anyway when I started college I thought that I could make a fresh start for myself and that girls would talk to me but that failed, no girl would talk to me at all and i didn't bother trying because I realised I'm just so ugly and that it's not my fault for being born ugly. I got a really nice haircut and the next night I was out in a nightclub and a hot girl approached me on the dance floor and was rubbing herself against me and I couldnt believe it because nothing like this in my entire life has ever happened to me but anyway if you are wondering what happened, that girl's friend came and grabbed her away from me, no she didn't signal to her friend or anything, her friend was a being a cockblock to me. I went out 2 more nights from that night and the first night nothing happened because the nightclub was full of dudes and there were 8 other girls and 4 of them were with their boyfriends and the 2nd night there was 2 girls rubbing up against me but i was really nervous and I didn't make a move and they walked away. In college I started to notice girls looking at me a lot and I've never ever seen girls looking at me before. I remember a really hot girl was in front of me in college cafteria qeue and she kept looking back at me and rubbing her hand through her hair, but i am a shy person and I am so insecure about my freckles as well because I didn't want to look back at her because I feel sorry for anybody who has to see my freckles because they are so UGLY!!!!! but anyway getting back to the point, I had my whole future planned out that I was going to die alone and I didn't mind at all because I'm ugly but only because girls actually started to notice and actually talk to me I actually care about being a virgin and I don't want to be a virgin anymore and this lock down is driving me mad at the moment.
