Good afternoon, members of r/tipofmyjoystick. I need your help finding a game that I still remember to this very day. For context, it was the the summer of 2008. My family was visiting our grandparents' house,as wee didn't get to see them very often. Our grandparents didn't really have any form of entertainment for the younger ones, but during the summer of 2008, they went out their way to buy us kids a video game system. But, at the time, they didn't really have that much money laying around, so they went to a local thrift store to get us something, which ended up being one of those shitty bootleg systems. Those systems with really poor build quality, and some which have the nerve to say that  they have over 800,000 games on it. But still, when you have little, you make the best you have with it. So, I plugged it in, and started playing with it. Then console itself had a total of, I think, 500 games on it. I had a fairly basic selection of games on it, with games like Super Godzilla, Road Rash 3, and some stupid game called Action 52. Then we get to the game that want to focus on. The game itself, I'll be honest, I can only remember the bare minimum. The game was a bit of a shooter game, in which you control a guy, shooting other guys. I would say it was it something like Contra, but it was more of a Space Invaders-type game. The only other things I can remember about it was it once said "Fuck", and it actually showed dead bodies. I remember seeing the first dead body in the game, and me screaming my lungs out as a result of it. My parents had to come in and shut the system off, and they were trying their best to explain what, was happening, and how it was just a game. Later in, I want to say 2014, I brought this game back up to my parents, and they admitted that even they were confused and disturbed at what they saw.  That's all I can give. Thank you for listening, and try your best if you go looking.
