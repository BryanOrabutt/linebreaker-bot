So like I kinda messed up a friendship with one of my closest friend So he send me a text on Monday and it was going well he then shut doesnâ€™t respond so it bugged me and I thought it was weird since usually he either leaves it on read doesnâ€™t respond because if you leave it on read you at least show you read it well he didnâ€™t even read it which is not like him at all .so then on Wednesday I send him a text hey how are you ,I worry about you no response.so I have just gotten i new phone recently so I use my old phone with service and send him a message with my old phone I pretended to be a fake person who had bought my old phone and was looking at old messages that I didnâ€™t delete (I know stupid I am still pissed at what I did ðŸ˜­)he asked who the seller was and said my name he texted me and called me asking I know itâ€™s you I told him the first time no and he asked again I said itâ€™s me and he said I knew it we had a 17 minute long conversation about it he explained his side that he doesnâ€™t respond to text sometimes and doesnâ€™t text people everyday he then says that the only person he texts all the time is his sister .i began telling my story that I am tired of him ignoring me I have to act clingy so you have to notice me .so then he told me to never bring it up again and that he doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen .i apologized for everything.couple of hours later passed and I send him a text saying that I needed a 7 day break from him to hopefully restore trust and to realize the bad action of what I did .he said that the break idea was a good idea .and from then he sent a text explaining why he hasnâ€™t blocked me cause I had asked him I read the text but didnâ€™t respond cause Iâ€™m on the 7 day break Iâ€™m on day 2 .so what do you think I should do about this like should I just never text him after the 7 day break or what ?. I just need advice on what I should do Cause I already screwed up so donâ€™t know what to do :/
