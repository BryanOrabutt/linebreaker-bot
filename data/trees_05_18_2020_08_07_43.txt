...was watching this race today while high af and though "damn dude, I havent watched this wwe corpo circle racing crap in some time, feels so unreal, and somewhat, boring and cookie cutter lmao" I don't like NASCAR as much as when I was a kid due to its shenanigans and their prohibitionist stance on weed, but tuned in to this race because there is this one dude that won a virtual race and it was like a BIG deal 1 month ago because there was no real life Racing in a long foreseable future, and this dude is very very VERY talented but also very underfunded (fun fact: he was born in the same place were the dude that conspired to waste Lincoln was born, there are only like 12 inhabitants there lmao) watching him run in the back today and getting lapped while a Big Beer â„¢ sponsored car with gaZIllions on sponsorship and R&D won and grabbed the Checkers, was kinda depressing, and a reminder of how unfair "real" world is(tho he beat Byron, who was his fiercest rival in the Virtual races and runs the most funded team sponsored by the dudes that lobbied against Cannabis in the ol boys alcapone days, and also beat 7 time champion) It happens that, this dudes' team is the one and only that had got a weed sponsor for a race, but got denied, screwed and laughed at by the gatekeepers of the sport back then. As you and everyone knows my Ents, in the real world reality is that money gets shit done, and in the past, Reddit has made it to back up a talented but underfunded NASCAR dude with the Dogecoin thing and Josh Wise, so I figured I must ask Reddit to help me and help Timmy Hill to hit up on Dennis Rodman (PotCoin) Snoop Dogg (Merry Jane), Mendo Dope (duh), Randy Marsh (Tegridy), or any other weed act or brand You can think of to throw some weed sales spare change and sponsor this Alien's dude ass, like srsly this guy is the REAL DEAL, He can be the next Dale Earnhardt or Richard Petty, he is also a very humble bloke that has grinded and hustled in small start and park dumpster fire teams to were he is rn (unlike most of the "Top dogs" that are rich daddy spoiled diamond spoon kids, Timmy has a racing daddy tho he is not rich), he deserves the opportunity of running a fully funded car that can compete with the top dogs and kick some ass, and poof poof pass on the Beer cars. Good smokes y'all
