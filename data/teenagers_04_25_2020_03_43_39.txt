We were friends for only around a year but grew extremely close as the year went by. I stayed at his house almost every weekend and even spent most of my summer at his house. But recently he started becoming distant and brief with me, this lasted for about a week and I hinted at the odd behavior but he just brushed it off and ended the conversation. After a while of us not talking at all, he decided to text me asking about graduation stuff and as usual it was brief. I tried to continue the conversation by letting him know this behavior between us has been odd and once again he brushed it off as nothing. At this point I decided I would let him know how i genuinely felt about the situation and this time he actually told me he knew he wasn’t being himself, He kept blaming his behavior on (1 thing I will not mention) and him isolating himself. I was extreme happy he noticed what I had been talking about  so I then tried to continue to reach out to him and help only for it to end in me not even getting a response out of him. This really set me off, so instead of just hinting at the behavior I decided to be brutally honest with him and held nothing back. I told him I didn’t want to be his friend if he was going to continue act this way and his response was “okay, bye!”  At this time I began to realize he didn’t care as much as I thought he did and so I decided to tell him his behavior shouldn’t be determined by him isolating himself and the other reason I won’t mention. We haven’t talked since. Although I’m happy that I was able to go through with it (letting him know I didn’t wanna be friends and how he was acting)  I’m genuinely upset about it too, I don’t like the thought of us not being friends and I know it’s gonna bother me for the next few days but I feel I did the right thing, it was all emotionally draining and I was tired of it. I really do hope we become friends again but only if he fully realizes how the situation was and shows he once again, he does care
