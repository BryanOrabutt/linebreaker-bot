 i was so frustrated and tired from ocd. My ocd started giving me worried and telling me not to look at a certain person. I tried not to look at him and not even have him in my vision field. Something snapped inside me and I started staring him. ocd was giving me worries like    ocd:you may have made a promise to a God.           me: i ignore you                                    ocd kept bugging me and my mind started provoking ocd without my will. the provoking thoughts without my will started containing the word God and it may looked as if I was provoking Him but I was not. i was just trying to ignore my ocd and due to frustration provoking thoughts without my will popped up. I think, I tried to fast pray to God to tell Him that they are without my will but I was so tired and frustrated and could not concetrate. instead of that, the provoking thoughts without my will kept popping up i think it last for 10 seconds and I realised how scary these thoughts without my will were, that I was able to pray to a God and tell Him that they were without my will and I could not control them or pray to tell Him they were without my will earlier. i am confused and worried because these thoughts without my will, lasted, I think, 10 seconds? in other cases the thoughts without my will last, I think, 3 seconds. how can i be sure that they were 100% without my will? why they lasted, i think, 10 seconds? ocd is like             ocd: provoking thoughts without your will for so many seconds? are you sure you did not mean them? you looked so careless and frustrated when they were popping up. what if you meant them for some seconds just because you were angry and frustrated?
