i’m a 20 year old (F) and never been in a relationship. I have many reasons why I haven’t, some being that i’m very insecure, don’t really go to places where I can mingle, and i’m very picky. my major problem is insecurity ever since I had depression, it just made it a million times worse. in high school I honestly never thought about getting in a relationship, like I didn’t care enough and I was just content with myself until I began working. people always ask me about having a boyfriend and act surprised when I say I don’t which kind of makes me feel worse like something is really wrong with me. some guy would always ask me if I had a bf so I felt like I was almost wrong for not having one like it was mandatory which obviously it isn’t. I began to think about it more and my depression just makes my thoughts intense and makes me over dramatic. now I want to be in a relationship so bad and I admit I crave male attention like crazy to the point where I most need it to feel even a little bit beautiful and it’s sickening. I know I know better but sometimes I try to force myself to not care so much so I can do bad things that makes me feel good. people say you should love yourself before someone else but I feel like that will be never for me and I want to be with a man even though I don’t love myself. though you shouldn’t rely on someone for happiness, being with someone could make you really happy and being around people that make you feel loved and beautiful can really boost your happiness right? I have never been intimate with someone, maybe if I had that i’d be happy, to have someone as a best friend and to occupy my time. maybe they’d help me with my depression and get me out because I have something to look forward to, someone to encourage me, so I don’t feel alone. maybe that’s what I need, maybe I can find self love by being with someone. just a thought, don’t think i’m crazy lol, I hope you get what i’m saying
