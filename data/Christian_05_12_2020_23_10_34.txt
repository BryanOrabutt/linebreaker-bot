Good afternoon🌇, today is a beautiful day an amazing day to give out gifts🎁. I could give out a thousand dollars💷 but it would not be durable, it can get wet, it can rip and  burn into ashes. I can give out a 2020 Honda Civic or a 2020 Ford Mustang, it will not pass away the thirst💧 in the hearts of man. Even if I Payed all your bills would not be sufficient enough to fill up the void🕳 or the hole inside of Man's heart. If we would be reasonable for a second  and ask where does that hole come from? It comes from the fall of Man ( Genesis 3 verse 21-23). What did they lose? Man lost the most precious💎 thing to them "the presence of God".  Since the fall of humanity, we have always been looking for a substitute for the presence of God and nothing has ever been comparable.  Genesis 3 v 7📖 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Since Man lost the presence we needed a plan of reparation, as you can see in this verse they tried using fig leaves symbolic to our substitution, Nothing was able to cover the nakedness or the  embarrassment of sin. in verse 21  The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed 👔them. God clothing them is a foreshadow of the plan of salvation, a foreshadow of Jesus coming to lay his life on the cross✝️ for our sins; taking our shame, saving us from the wrath of God and repairing our relationship with the living God. There is nothing🚫 from drugs to medication💊to yoga🧘‍♀️ or therapy that can bring back the peace😃 we had in the Garden, the joy that surpasses all understanding🔍. Nothing ever worked nothing will ever work, a lot think if they become a billionaire 🤑all their problems and stress will go; unbelievably  when they reach that level they still seek for peace and happiness. Despite their great net worth's💸💶 a lot eventually commit suicide, when investigated they are described as fragile  souls searching for answers to existential questions. The answer🗣 is here, the gift🎁is here, and it's even  free🆓️. The presence of Jesus has the answer to all problems, the solution to all issues internal or external; all he is ask is come and surrender  to him and  believe in him ( John 3 v 16). Matthew 11 v 28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 🙌
