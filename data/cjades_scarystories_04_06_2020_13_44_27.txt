my name is amber i'm 16 and live in a small town in England. in October of 3 years ago we moved from one small town to another, this story starts in my old house. from a young age of about 3 or 4 i would talk to nothing and play around at home as if i was playing with someone else, a few years ago me and my mum were talking about it and she told me one Christmas she asked me who i was talking to while playing with my new barbie alone in the living room and i replied with Richard, Richard was my dads granddad who's wedding photo was framed on top of the shelf i was playing under that framed photo was one of the thing we had taken from his house when we emptied it after he dies at home. though that one occurrence was what seemed to be my granddad the rest of my experiences from that point DEFINATLEY weren't what happened after was evil and not out to be nice. at about 10 or 11 i would walk home from school with friends as my parents worked and on Thursdays my sister would go straight to her friends after school so i would be home alone for about half an hour after school one Thursday home alone i remember being upstairs in my room and hearing my dads guitar which was in their bedroom strum aggressively i assumed it was my cat though still felt off so i ran downstairs and sat in the living room but when i sat down i saw all 3 of my cats sat on the sofa. i have so many more stories from that house but i don't want to write too much on this post as the best stories are at my new house. at my new house the activity didn't start until about a year of living here which was a relief at the start but now its worse than ever. it started with the footsteps in the upstairs landing while i was in my room with the door shut i had knocking on my bedroom door and all sorts but as a dumb teenager i had some friends over for Halloween and we decided to play the Ouija board that my sister had framed in her room that she bought from a car boot sale that looked old and scratched up (my sister has a very creepy aesthetic and has loads of creepy shit like that) for the first 15 minutes nothing happened but then it started some of the girls started asking stupid questions like what color are my underwear but whats creepy is the answers where always right no matter the questions it got creepy when i asked their name it aggressive and quickly spelled out Jamie which was my best friends passed dads name he passed the year before from a long fight with cancer so she got exited and started talking to him. id read about things like that family coming through and i wasn't sure and felt uneasy so i asked the board whats your birthday Lorraine (my friend who's 'dad' was communicating with us) looked at me confused and the board went to 0, an indication it was never born which means it wasn't her dad the bored wen t crazy and one of my other friend took their hand off which is really dangerous i said goodbye and put the board back in the frame and back in my sisters room and we all forgot about it later that night. from then on its been awful i feel like its the same person as my old house the spirit feels the same just angrier. like last week i was home alone and in the shower i heard a deep male voice outside the door though i have no idea what it said it scared me so much i sat in the bathroom until my parents got home i have so many more Ouija board stories and paranormal stories so i might write more posts but this one is so long i'm going to leave it here
