This might seem jumbled and like im rambling but bear with me im just trying to type this out for my own sake. I met my Padawan 6 years ago online playing video games. Lets just call him "K". K was a few years younger than me and was obviously struggling deeply with his mental health. After talking to him for awhile i realized our lives and personal difficulties  almost paralleled eachothers exactly. We both LOVE Star Wars. The way his voice would change tone from sad to excited when id bring it up to distract him. I spent countless nights staying up with him on discord talking about Lore or what we thought would happen in RoS. ( he would have loved it just because it was Star Wars). I passed on advice to him the best i could, just told him what had worked for me in the past and would sit and hear him out no matter how long it took, He jokingly said one time "ya know your sort of like my master when it comes to this" and from then on out id always jokingly tease him referring to him as "Youngling" or "Padawan. "it doesnt make sense now but thats because youre still a padawan learner." was a teasing reassurance id often give. Shortly after the release of Fallen Order "K" got really bad again. I couldnt distract him anymore with the usually SW quips. I could feel him slipping. In our last conversation he told me if i could beat Fallen Order on Grandmaster he'd buy it cause then hed know "it was east enough  to relax and play" (he was always witty in the way he teased me) SInce he passed I havent  touched the game it was too difficult to not think of him. Its been a almost 2 months and im going to do it. Im gonna beat it on Grandmaster for K. In a lot of ways he didnt realize he was actually the Master, K taught me so much about strength, perseverance and frienship. Thanks for letting me vent. Just know when youre in a dark place K, the force and I will be there by your side. May the Force be with you.
