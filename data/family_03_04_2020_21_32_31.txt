So yesterday was my birthday (2nd Mars), and i have been looking forward for my birthday for a very very long time. My parents have always given birthday presents to me and my brothers and both of my brothers got very nice gift for their birthdays, my parents asked what i wished for my birthday and i had a hoodie, jeans t shirts and a cap on my wishlist (sorry bad grammar not from english speaking country) nothing too special i didn’t want a specific expensive brand or anything. And my parents have always had money, they never struggled with money but they are not rich either. And my birthday comes and i get a couple t shirts and a charger as birthday presents, i don’t wanna sound ungrateful because i am really not but this plays a little part in the story. So i wake up and receive my gifts and the day goes ( i have school) and when i come home i just chill nothing special and then my parents said that we are leaving for the restaurant (around 19:00) and i’m really excited. And they take me to a fast food restaurant where we just eat kebab. I still don’t wanna sound ungrateful but it’s just that my parents have both time and money and did very nice things for my brothers both younger and older than me that’s why i was expecting a cool restaurant or something not a small, loud fast food place. But we could still get home and maybe they something planned, and when we get home they have not bought any snacks or no cake or nothing (there was no dessert at the fast food place) so i was just laying alone in my bed watching youtube the rest of the night and we didn’t even have school the day after. I am not ungrateful it’s just that i have been looking forward for this birthday for months and i just wanted to have a nice, chill, cozy night with my family and maybe watch i movie. Instead i am writing this the day after while crying and just sad that i have been waiting so long for something to just be super disappointing :( plz don’t post hate
