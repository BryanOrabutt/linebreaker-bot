Let me make this clear I've supported this game since day 1,I have bought all 3 Battle Passes and even tho I've have not felt they improved the content in them I assumed that in time they would eventually give us something of more value. But the greediness this time has no excuse you make us pay for a 50 tier battle pass and you keep saying it's the same value as the 100 tier one yet I don't see the value, it's just 1 unique variant with crates that aren't even unique I mean a Season 3 Daily crate?a DeepShark S36 skin? Tickets for Season 3 Gold Crates? What's the value in that? The odds of unlocking weapons in crates are so unfair that the "Value" is not what you keep saying it is. most of us won't get the weapons because those odds are impossible even by paying $$$ and completing the battle pass and then spending money on the same crates outside of the battle pass, paid content is needed if the game is to be kept alive but come on if you are selling us a Battle pass give us more more than 2 unique variants and let me remind you that most of us will only get 1 unique variant because the second one is locked on a season exclusive crate that you might not even unlock by the end of the season. You have more than 2 variants in the battle pass but why give us variants of already existing weapons in the base game, why not give us the players who support the game by paying you money unique weapons like the Razorback and the Man O War even if they are re skins just give us some worthy variants in the battle pass, you can keep the awesome variants on the lucky draw and crates but for god sakes just gives unique guns on the battle pass instead of filling it with meaningless crates and weapons I am not going to support this game any more by spending money for content, you made us wait 1 season for the second map you promoted for Season 3 and then you didn't even add the second Zombies map and now Season 4 is only 1 month long?  by the next season you'll probably give us a 20 tier battle pass with the "same value". The community should re evaluate what this game is becoming they are trying to squeeze as much money as they can and now it's the time to either try to make a change or just flat out let them continue on this Pay 2 Win road they've taken.
