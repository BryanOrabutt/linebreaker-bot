My boyfriend and I, he would send love paragraphs every hour. He’d text on endless hours. Even when I slept he would text me saying “Ik you are going to be mad at me staying up but I wanted to say that I really really love you” he used to say all these poetic thing and he was so committed. Sometimes we would just stare endlessly into each other’s and and he looks happier than any picture I’ve seen him in with anyone. Then around this month his ex contacted him. His depressive state was worse then ever. I was always able to make him happy but apparently “no one can make him happy.” He was afraid he still loved her. But he “feels weird whenever he talked to her” He really loved me. He used to do anything for me. But then his ex came in.....he stopped being happy. He stopped being wholesome and romantic. He became vague. But apparently he “still loves me and that has never changed since the moment he met me.” Then yesterday he told me he was going to commit suicide this summer. I cried over voice message because he “just couldn’t do call”. I asked him do you want me to stop loving you. He replied with “if it makes you stop hurting yes” I told him it doesn’t and then he said “it does tho”. He told me he hurts everyone and it kills him and “just let me die already” then he said “You should find someone healthy mentally”, “I’m broken no amount of love can fix me” “I can’t continue like this. I’ve always been better off alone” he “hates to brake up with me but he has to” and that “he can’t be with me anymore.” He always has a really really hard time letting go of people especially girls. He told me he loved me more than anything more than anyone. But if he has such a hard time letting go, how come he left me. Should I let him be or text him. I feel he’s going to come crawling back to me. That’s just how he is. He can’t let go of people. Usually when I have a gut feeling it’s right. But my gut tells me he’ll come back. Should I text him or just wait?!?!
