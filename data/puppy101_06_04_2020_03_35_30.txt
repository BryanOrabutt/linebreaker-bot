So i never thought this was actually something that would happen to anybody but today i found out from the groomers that my puppy who i very well thought was a female is actually a male. Now, before anyone starts questioning me on how i did not know this for the month i had him, i just want to put it out there that i am a first time pet owner with very little knowledge. It’s very hard to tell he was a male anatomically especially since he is VERY fluffy. The pet store that i got him at (who gets their puppies from certified breeders) told me that he was a female and ALL the written documentation i have says female on every single page there’s at least 7 pages which state my puppy is a female. Even the paper from the vet he got his first shots at wrote down that he is a female. I did not question his sex at all since this is what was written so i didn’t think twice to check for myself or even question it sooner. I’m just completely vivid right now, i bought him pink everything and the worst is that i’ve been calling him a female name this whole time.  I just dont know what to do from this point on, i did change his name (now i need to train him to respond to his new name) and buy new stuff but i do not know how to go about approaching the store i got him from and complaining. I feel like i deserve some type of discount from them and most importantly i need some new documentation! I don’t know if they gave me the wrong dog or if they just gave me the wrong papers or if they only had males left and lied to my face. I am just in complete shock and mostly just feel disappointed. I love him of course but i just can’t believe this happened to me! I am just super embarrassed i’ve told everyone in my family my dog was a female and now i need to break the news i just feel completely stupid. But i do know this is partly not my fault... how would you guys react in this situation ? how would you go about approaching the owner of the store?
