I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now, fell for her instantly. We've been living together most of the time. She has always been at my throat to be in an open relationship to get anything I want to get out before we get too attached. She has been more sexually active than i have before we got together where as i haven't (my choice btw). She kept hinting at threesomes in almost everything, she even made out with a random girl while we were together and I was not there. (I have a high sexual appetite, these things turn me on so that was ok for me) I was never a person to venture in inviting people into my relationship but it started to peake my interest as it seemed like she was into it. We vaguely spoke about the rules, just discussed the don'ts. We never really got to it because she wanted it to be someone she knew I wanted it at random. (At this point I was still taking it as a joke). She kept bringing it up ever so often that I subconsciously gave in. Till a day we were drunk and opportunity met circumstance and I made a move for it to happen. It was a mature woman early 30's and she was in to this stuff so I pushed the threesome. She was hesitant but I was too drunk to notice, I was having fun we fucked first then the lady  joined, sucking her off and I penetrated her while this was happening thinking everything was ok... as soon as it was over that's when everything fell apart... my girlfriend's face was distrot she was devastated... it was like she was testing me all the time to see if I will actually do it and I did, I broke her heart... all I thought was that she wanted it, and I was doing  it to make her happy, I'm happy once she is.. but it destroyed our relationship, she started to accuse me of all kind of things till there was no trust anymore and we separated recently... ANY SUGGESTIONS HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.. we are still trying but it feels like she gave up on us... I do love her and all I want to do is make her happy..
