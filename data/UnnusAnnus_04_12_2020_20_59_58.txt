So this happened 2 years ago. I always liked to visit scary places and I had a roommate which dragged me to an old abandoned hotel in our town. From the looks of it it was old and the best thing about this hotel was it was burned down 11 times and there was no explaination how. So I’ve been there before and it was an amazing old house to see. One day me and my friends from school went there and I made a little vlog about it. They had never been there and I did a grand tour and we took some photos for school too(we were all in photography school at the time). And then started things go wrong. Me and my friend went to make a video on the top floor and as we were going back we thought we heard something. I was recording and the bang we heard was on video too. After 1 hour we decided to go back to school and then I started to watch all videos I made. I cought some fucking noises we couldn’t explain and some orbs. I didn’t mind that at the time but my friend asked me if someone died there because she had a bad feeling. I said no but I didn’t know someone did die in that hotel. A married couple got to that hotel as their vacation in 1832 and the bride killed her husband and then herself. My friedn freaked out and then the bad things started to happen. My phone was not working as it should be, it started glitching, while I was driving from work my car stopped showing my speed and the thing went crazy, I always had a feeling someone is watching me, when I was closing the caffee where I work the dishwasher went off by itself and that never happened before to anyone else(and even now its totaly okay), when my cat was in my room and I thought she jumped on the bed and started walking on my legs I woke up to see that the cat was dead asleep near my head. The things lasted for about a year and I told myself that I would never go back there and film some video just for fun.
