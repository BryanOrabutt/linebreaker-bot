Nah, y’all are wrong. The Kia spectra5 is best car hands down, long list of reasons why It’s good looking and still modern at that with its simple but elegant body lines and curves and slightly sloping roof line, comes in a variety of interesting colors three of which are red, blue, and orange, it’s hatchback body style lends itself to extreme practicality, despite the added bodywork it weighs less than 3000lbs coming in at 2835lbs (1285kg) which since its not a jacked up CUV, makes it really fun to throw around, it’s low weight and ride height and it’s fuel sipping 4 cylinder also gives it more than decent gas mileage for not having direct fuel injection, but that engine can come mated to a five speed making it tons more fun to wring out its 140 hp, because it’s a 2000s car it has just enough safety features to make it so parents would be comfortable with their kids driving one but it’s old enough to where there is almost no technological gimmicks to break, everything about it lends itself to being reliable, it’s also very cheap to purchase, I found a remarkably well kept one with low miles for sale at $3000 I’m sure they can go cheaper, it is easily modifiable, you can***\[*****5:26 PM*****\]***find good turbo kits made for Mitsubishi engines for relatively cheap and just bolt them on to the Kia spectra5’s engine because it is a variation of the 4g63, but if you choose to not mod it, it’s a low maintenance engine because of how simple and reliable it is, only thing you have to worry about is adjusting lifters and changing belts, in short the Kia spectra5 is the perfect car for new enthusiast driver because it is cheap, safe, reliable, practical, unique, good-looking, modifiable, lightweight, fuel-efficient, simple and cheap to maintain, fast enough to have fun, not fast enough to get into too much trouble, even Doug demuro says that the Kia spectra sedan is the best car he ever reviewed because you just don’t have to care what happens to it, imagine what he’d say about the hatch, it’s the best compromise of everything good about cars, that’s why it’s the best car ever made.
