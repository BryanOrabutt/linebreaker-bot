I’m the BS. I’ve never cheated on my WS. We are going through a divorce, still live together and have tried to reconcile on/off for the past couple of months. During this period, he has compromised and hacked my phone and is possibly tracking my car. In turn, I have never asked to monitor  or even look at his phone or keep tabs on him. He has a password to his phone and that’s fine. I’ve never asked for it. Because I already know what he’s capable of and what he’s done to me. I know enough, and it’s so bad...I don’t need to know more. What I don’t understand is...HE is the liar. The dishonest one. The manipulative one. The one who cheated. So, WHY am I being tracked?! lol It’s so f%^king unreal...it’s comical. I’m sure he’s reading this right now. And that’s fine. Because I have nothing to hide. We are currently reconciling. But it must be difficult for him. He knows I still want the divorce and that it will be final in a month.  He knows he betrayed me and has hurt me more than anyone in my life has ever hurt me. And I’m sure he feels like I will eventually cheat on him or leave him. It must be difficult. To have been disloyal and now know that you yourself do not deserve loyalty in return. That the marriage vows that he broke and I’m dissolving no longer apply to us. I have thought about revenge cheating, but I was honest with  him and told him, I also told him that I started a Tinder account. I’ve been honest with him and our therapist. I have no plans on having a revenge affair or meeting anyone else. I’ve ended the Tinder account. For the record, I never met anyone off of there. It was more to boost my self esteem...since my WS infidelities destroyed what little I had. I have been 100% transparent with him and have offered to let him view everything on my phone. So, there’s no reason to monitor it with the Spy App he installed. It’s just interesting...I’m the BS who was cheated on with over 50+ escorts, and yet I’m the one under surveillance.
