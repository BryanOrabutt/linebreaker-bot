Alright so I won’t overload you guys with too much details just looking for a honest opinion and I think I have a general idea on what I should do.  I have been dating this girl for year and half of always had a steady job, she ended up losing hers coasting on EI for few months she is a bartender so she does not get much maybe 800$ a month because she does not claim tips on taxes.. so I stepped up and supported her in every way I could financially and emotionally. 2 months into her EI she ended up rupturing her spleen.. which was very serious a lot of internal bleeding luckily I ended up driving her to the hospital or she would have died, she went into ICU for while were in November right now 2019 she stayed in the hospital for about a month and could not work for about 3 months prior of November, the bills were obviously racking up so I calmed EI myself for the extra 1000.00 every two weeks while working I know this is fraud but I had to do it so we were not on the streets, she has a child of 5 years old 50% custody with a recent court case in the mix so I couldn’t let her down.. I ended up claiming bankruptcy in December of 2019 because I put her before me I could not pay my bills. I lost about 30k in assets I lost my Harley two vehicles.. credit is done which is important.. and dished with 700$ monthly bill to the government for the next two years over it but hey.. For whatever reason I looked on her phone don’t judge me please.. but I seen her sexting with a guy from tinder November 14th dated when she was in the hospital.. and her ex boyfriend, it kinda hit me hard because I was the only one supporting her..  I asked her about it she lied several times and finally told me the truth and clams nothing happened but my argument is she wrote it November 14th and I caught it a month later I mean anything could have happened and there is a child involved. I’m having big trust issues and very hurt considering  I gave up everything for her..
