I was 21 and she was 19 at the time of our relationship, I used to like her a lot back in high school and after I graduated I tried getting close to her but she didn’t seem interested so I stopped talking to her, 2 years later her freshman year in college she throws herself at me and we started talking (which I found fishy) so come to find out she had a Bf (that took her virginity) before coming to me but had been a year since they broke up, so I  get over it, now when anything BF/GF vibes came between us it’d have to be off of me making the moves/intension while she goes along with it like if I’m the one who asked for the relationship and wants sex, I could tell her and her dorm mates wanted us to fuck because she was the only one who wasn’t getting dick out of them three, so the first time we had sex was more of because of that reason and not the vibes between us getting hot, it didn’t go well, it was my first time and I felt embarrassed telling her then because I started noticing she was just observing me and what I do and grading it, so I became too nervous so I would feel like I wanna finish soon as I start but didn’t want to and couldn’t keep it up with her because I was too focused on trying to please her and make it fun so I wouldn’t have to try and stay tuned in but I would notice I didn’t like how much she never did anything, I would try to spice it up so she’d get comfortable and give in but she would just play shy and say it’s been  a while since she’s had sex or been with a guy, she would  tell me to come lay with her and literally just wait for me to initiate everything even though she’s the one wants it and it stayed that way every single time we tried, she’d get mad that I couldn’t keep it up saying she felt ugly and blah blah, I’d tell her she’s beautiful and she knew how much I really liked her because what girl throws themselves at a guy they know that don’t like them? so physical appearance wasn’t it, I tried hinting I didn’t like her just laying there at least be playful I’m a Aries just give me a play fight moment and I’m hard as a rock hahaha, she wasn’t even much flirty with me outside the bed she was just the type to always wait for me to push up on her and she’d go along with it(chase game) which isn’t too much my style, I should have communicated better on that but I felt she was just gonna turn the other cheek like she always did, so as it continued I kept having the same issue, but also not overcoming the Virgin flaws (finish quick when I was finally was able to cum I didn’t feel comfortable finishing knowing she wanted her orgasm so I’d rather try until I got soft) I knew there were methods to overcome them but the situation between me and her made it hard for me to focus on it I would become frustrated that I had to get horny and be hot when nothing between us was hot to go off on, I would literally wait for her to invite me to the bed even my own bed! Because I was tired of looking like the one who wanted it most, but one time on a road trip she finally loosened up and play fight wit me for hours something I tried getting her to do for the past five years of knowing her, that turned me on and had me hard as steel and my adrenaline on fire and my body didn’t  feel like it’d get tired quick which I never had during any other time we had sex or flirted so we started to fuck and that time i was different beast, my strokes were smoother and constant she actually had her hand on my chest saying I’m hitting her walls (like that’s what she been wanting) which she never said before and even other times after this day it wasn’t like that moment, I felt like I could have went for a while and not finish quick I guess it was me figuring out what being turned on really feels like and it all being mental what I was learning, but we didn’t finish because her dorm mate came in the room with her BF and his friend, even after the energy was still hot like we just wanted to go else where and get it going, sadly that moment and energy never lived between us again and that was the second month into the relationship, I always tried being playful like usual but she wouldn’t give in she’d just go along with it( but quietly be the one who wants it most), I take the road trip as a moment she gave in because nobody could see or hear  it, she always said she never wanted her dorm mates or some one hearing her get fucked but I knew it was more than that I felt she was just selfish and wasn’t liking me much because I dealt with us having tension between us  because of her issues and her going on a date with a ten year older guy before we made it official because she was mad I didn’t say happy birthday and took it as I moved forward (which then let me know if I didn’t chase her she’d move on to the next) and being friends with guys that liked her and would tell her they couldn’t be in the same room as her if I’m around and they wasn’t emotional guys so it’d be bad vibes and disrespectful comments on the low coming from them that would make me have to respond if I’m not soft, and also not forget she was emotionally limited wit me specially when her ex would try to come around, so with everything that went on with her I became careless on trying but not smart to leave I looked at her as a friend at that point and didn’t wanna believe what I was feeling (rebound) I known her five years before that and the person that introduced us was a family friend of mine( also her cousin’s fiancé) and her family been knowing me for years so it was hard just walking away but I learned my lesson, but I still never forgot my actions, I know there two wrongs, I just wanna know do you think i was wrong for not sharing she was my first and kept trying to be things I wasn’t genuinely feeling towards her? I trusted her and wanted to tell her but with everything that came from her end made me instantly look at her different and lost trust, I feel me continuing the situation made me look like I was just wanting sex and was bitter about the previous ex but that was never the case, I would just give and try to be  what I though she wanted since she was emotionally unavailable with me  and the connection I tried having with her during the entire relationship, I felt like I gave her the upper hand on going about and moving on from the relationship like if I was the one who called her and said I wanted a relationship when it was the other way around
