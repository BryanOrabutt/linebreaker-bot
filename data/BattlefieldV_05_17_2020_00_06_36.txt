Bf v is really bad lack of guns and the story is garbage and I saw it coming with bf 1 they went out of their way to include a female and black people lol listen I love Harlem hellfighters they were some of the best soldiers in ww1 they kicked ass and I love they made a story about it but it’s bothering when they go out of their way to be politically correct them bf v came out and there’s British females screaming they need revived it ruins the game along with the severe lack of guns y’all should have put women in bf 4 it would somewhat make sense it’s modern combat but during the world wars there were no females in the combat roles except small exceptions like Russia using women as snipers but it’s ridiculous to me dice just worries too much about dumb shit now it’s about the gameplay not whether it’s politically correct and 1917 and 1944 were sure as hell not politically correct times it’s history everybody knows it when you have a ww2 game with female soldiers no swastikas and a severe lack of guns with a garbage story that takes glory away from real soldiers and gives it to a make believe teenage girl that’s a slap in the face I’m into military shit if I want make believe anything goes  I’ll go play call of duty I play bf for the realism the grit the realistic gameplay and immersion and it’s very hard to get immersed with female soldiers in a ww2 game or the proton weapons and lack of legit ww2 guns lol no swastikas I mean the game had issues to begin with putting politics in a product is never good for business and more increasingly over the years iv seen liberals specifically jam it into anything they even slightly have decision making power over just make the shit accurate stop trying to please libtards because they aren’t the ones buying your games history buff dudes who don’t give a shit about political correctness we are the ones who buys these games we want historical accuracy realism and to specifically NOT have politically views jammed into our games also yeah I don’t use punctuation oh well I don’t care so to all the grammar nazis fuck off this post isn’t for you lol
