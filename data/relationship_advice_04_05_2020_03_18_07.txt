Keep in mind i was single for 3 years before this relationship . So my boyfriend of 3 months and I have been arguing so much lately, we dated & got to know each other for 4-5 months before we actually decided to get in a relationship and it was good, it was great until I started noticing now that when he gets jealous he always wants to act as if I’m his property, no guy can look or stare at me because he’ll automatically start hugging me & start being all over me, and I hate it. I feel like it’s like him saying I’m his property. The other day I tweeted something saying my best friend didn’t answer and I didn’t have anyone to rant to, some guy commented and said “ft me anyways work is slow rn” and my boyfriend was super mad about it, told me to tell the guy to ft him & so I said why don’t u tell him ? And he continued to say for me delete the guy, he never once asked if it was a friend or someone I knew . I told him he was overreacting & he said to delete the guy or to forget about our relationship. I told him it was stupid for him to give me an ultimatum over something like that . And when he gets mad or frustrated he’ll raise his voice at me & I used to let it happen but I got so tired of it and started raising my voice too . He’s super clingy, and I tell him I need my space bc I’m not the type who is super affectionate and he always says something like that I don’t love him or I’m not happy with him and he’s even asked if someone else has my attention. And no one else does but it all just starting to feel like it’s weighing me down, and I’m trying to keep it going bc when it’s good, it’s great I really enjoy it but lately it’s just too much and it’s only been 3 months, idk if maybe I’m just being dramatic and I was just used to being single or and let it go or if enough is enough before it gets worse.... what should I do ?
