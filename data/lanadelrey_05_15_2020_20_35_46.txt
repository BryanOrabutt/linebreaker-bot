The first time I discovered Lana del Rey I was in my room quite frankly I was really bored while listening to her.I soon got really into her after a week or so.I wanted to go to my old music but something just kept me coming back to her although her music was slow and „boring“.I don’t know what it was about her but she was just so magical like she was taking me to another world,another dimension.It was like I was seeing through her brilliant mind with every music video.The slow jams were kinda getting to me and I grew to love born to die.                                                 I was in a really bad state of mind and decided to listen to some Lana del Rey and then I realized that I was just listening to Born to die  and nothing else.       Then I gave a listen to Ultraviolence and I literally felt like my sadness got multiplied X10.        Then came my favorite album Honeymoon.By the way UV is a whole fucking bible but something about honeymoon just got me relaxed...made me forget...made me kinda happy.I mean some of the tracks like Honeymoon,Terrence loves you and Freak literally spiritually elevated me.          Then came lust for life.It was..a journey.Lana really out here trying to cure the depression she gave me lol.When I heard love I literally started crying.Nothing makes me cry but that..I don’t know what it is but it kinda reminded me of honeymoon because of its softness..like we were just coming out of honeymoon and going into LFL.It was like a bridge to me between the two albums.Some of my favorites include heroin,summer bummer,when the world was at war we kept dancing,etc...I just went to check on YouTube for some more LFL songs that I liked and I realized I loved the whole album.                        Norman fucking Rockwell was amazing.I really liked Venice bitch for its softness idk I guess I’m just kinda a sucker for soft songs and violins lol.      I know I didn’t really talk about Ultraviolence that much but honestly what I said is the only thing I remember.I don’t like it that much anymore since the music makes me so sad and I’m much happier now so I don’t think I need UV anymore.I will make sure I get back to it when I’m feeling down though.Ultraviolence although it’s really dark is like a pat on the shoulder saying it will all be okay and you won’t end up like the other woman lol.Tell me what your first listen was like I bet it’s really interesting!Btw thank you for reading all of this.Just thought I’d write my thoughts down lol.Have a beautiful day and stay safe!
