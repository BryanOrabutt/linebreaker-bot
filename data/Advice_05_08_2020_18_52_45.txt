hi im sorry if my english is not very good its not my first language. please give me advice regarding anxiety during zoom classes. so my school is forcing us to open our web cameras and sit in front of the computer for 3 hours every day and i cant even manage 3 minutes because of extreme social anxiety. i swear i know its irrational but i feel extreme panic over showing people my face in my room like this because our classes arent very structured and basically my classmates just talk to each other and i have to listen to them because i dont ever talk to my classmates. it just gives me extreme anxiety sitting even 10 minutes with my webcam opened not saying a word and feeling people judging me. im scared that not attending is going to have bad consequences in the future like not being able to go to college because of low behaviour grade ( idk how to call it basically in my country if you dont attend classes you get a low grade in how you behave) and thats my most important goal going to college. im in year 11 btw and we go to college after 12th grade. idk i just really dont want to sit with my webcam opened but im scared of the consequences. and ive been talking to my ex "boyfriend" because he doesnt attend and i wanted to know if its ok to do that and i guess i was asking too many questions because he told me that its weird that im asking him about school and he blocked me because i was stressing him out. i kept asking another girl, classmate, if she thinks its going to have any consequences not going on the online classes and again i stressed her out too much and now i think she thinks im insane :( im just so sad that no one understand the distress i feel. please tell me if you think its going to have any grave future consequences not participating in online classes during this time? i have one month left of school. please help me:( and talking to the teachers is not an option they are really close minded about mental issues like anxiety.
