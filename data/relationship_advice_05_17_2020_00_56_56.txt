My girlfriend that I was dating for a year dumped me 2 days ago and before she did for 2 weeks  she was acting different in hindsight rn it wasn’t that bad she was just a little distant but she used to be so clingy and affectionate so I was worried and kept bothering her trying to fix the problem she finally figured out what was the problem or so she said but I was really mad and tired of those two weeks so i said some stuff but mostly I said I hated her then ignored her for a day I called her the next day and she said we aren’t good anymore and we might not be okay she ignored me for the next two days then asked to break up her reasons were I never defend her when my friend made fun of her which rarely happened because I never actually hung out with my friends because I was always with her then she said the two weeks of bothering didn’t help and over all she feels like the cons out weigh the pros for the relationship I begged her to give me a second chance but she said no and we haven’t talked since I know I’ve messed up a couple times but she never told me something was wrong she also said that she didn’t like I called her bro and sis which was a joke and she said she didn’t mind back when I started calling her it and I asked her she said she didn’t mind but now says which woman would ever want to be called that I know that I messed up a couple times I wasn’t perfect but was it really all my fault for her ending it not to compete or anything but she has also done so much shitty things to me and things were okay two weeks ago but out of nowhere everything started falling apart for no reason and now I’m so miserable because the person I thought would be in my life forever is gone she even promised to marry me introduce me to her family and we even decided our kids name maybe we got too close to fast but things felt so natural and good and every time something went wrong we would deal with it should I give up on trying to her or should I give her some space for a month or so then see how she feels what’s the right thing to do in situation I’m just so confused I don’t even feel like the last 4 days are real I’m so exhausted and wish we could just go back to normal but apparently I guess she wasn’t happy with things but she never actually told me oh yeah I just remembered I also lied to her and said I’ve been texting other girls and they make me more happy than you and one of them sent me nudes it was a lie and I told her it was when she wanted to break up she broke down in tears when I told her but still said she wanted to break up
