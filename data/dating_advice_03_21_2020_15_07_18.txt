M23 met f22 at bar and we hit it off pretty good and seems to be somewhat of a spark. She was playing hard to get at first which I liked but later turned out to be her still being in love with ex. She would text him often and sometimes right in front of me but made it seem like I was insecure for saying something about it. And would cry about him sometimes to me. I believe her that I’m the only person she really likes but she just can’t get over him. Recently ended things with her because of this somewhat mutually but she said she wanted to be friends and I said we should just not see eachother because she still has feelings for ex and I didn’t want to be just friends. She definitely likes me and would drunk text me often. We had sex several times over the course of 2 months or so, but could never connect deeply or have any deep conversations with eachother and she would hold out/ not ask me many questions or ask about my day much, or when I told her I had a shitty day she never cared to elaborate on why. She did always maintain she wanted to be friends first but we would always end up cuddling or having sex when we hung out- obviously was always some attraction between us. Any advice? Feel like I friend zoned myself by allowing her to text him without seeming to care cause I would just play it cool not to seem insecure. Obviously it bothered me. He lives 15 hours away in the military so it’s not like she can see him easily but she still texts him constantly. Definitely felt disrespected by her more than a few times but we weren’t that serious yet so I just played it off. Any chance to turn it around, wait it out, or hit her up and try to get him out of her head? Haven’t talked in a week or so since we ended things. Thanks all. Never been in this situation before so I’m not sure what to do. Really like her, and know she would be more about me if not for her ex. Sorry for the long question! Just confused on what to do.
