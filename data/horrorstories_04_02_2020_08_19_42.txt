It was a Thursday night around 9:45 and seeing there was a nice little fog I felt like I had to wander in it. I was 23 at the time and was living with my fianceé, now my wife, who loved the rain amd fog as much as me. I would have invited her to go along, but she was working, and honestly I'm glad she wasn't there given the circumstances. I'm not a superstitious person, I actually practice the Old Ways so I know some if the perversions Christians laid upon the truth. That being said somethings you just don't fuck with. I had walked about a mile and suddenly the fog had gotten thicker; like San Francisco in the morning thick. Then I heard it. Sent chills up my spine at first since it was so sudden. Then I realized what it sounded like, a mixture of a deep throaty laugh and a coyote howling. A grotesque sound that made me nauseous and even worse I could tell it was getting closer and the footsteps coming in my direction. I turned to look and saw a black silhouette against the fog. A giant hulking wolf like shadow moved slowly towards me, laughing horrifically at me. I could feel my heart in my throat as I told my body to move, but nothing happened. Eyes wide I saw the things muzzle poke out of the fog, maw open wide drool cascading to the ground. All I could do was mutter, "Dandy's Devil Hound!" as a flash hit my arm. The bastard got me with a claw, but it brought me back to my senses and I ran. The devil dog didn't make much of an attempt for me, I never understood why, didn't care. I made it home just as my fianceé did and told her what happened. She said there was no fog; I asked other friends and they agreed no fog that night. On a rare occasion when a fog rolls in at night, I stay clear of the doors and windows and refuse to leave the house. On those nights though a deep throaty laughing howl pierces my ears, I'm the only one who hears it. All I can do is light a black candle and wait.
