With this whole virus thing going around it's been hard to get what we need to feed our kids. Between limits put per transaction because of people just outright hording. My SO went to the store to get basics, bread, milk, eggs, ect. She also wanted to get chocolate milk mix for our daughter. She loves have hot chocolate with us in the morning when we are having our coffee. She is also delayed and autistic so the lack of said mix is a frustration and stress for her as it pulls from her routine of having hot chocolate while we have our coffee and with lunch (what she usually gets at school). My SO decided to try to get some. There was one small container on the shelf as the rest was all wiped out. She then noticed a man running for it. The race was on at that point and she won. This father then proceeded, in the middle of the store, to yell at her about how badly he needs that mix because he has kids at home. My SO, who is rather jaded due to a terrible past and has no f's to give, replied in kind that she does too, then walked away. This man then tried to follow her through the store yelling at her to give the mix to him because he needs it more. Now fun note:my SO has severe anxiety and has horrid allergies. Her allergist, upon reviewing her test results, told her, with a deep heavy sigh and a look of pity, that she is a very allergic person. She began to have a sneezing fit that she had been trying to suppress. This father lost interest after her sneezing fit and she suddenly had a 6ft radius around her as everyone moved away quickly. Silver lining? When she got home our daughter was so happy and excited to have her hot chocolate with mommy and mama in the morning and with lunch that she ran head long into my SO hugging and kissing her. My daughter is not about the cuddle life(mostly due to her autism) so just the small act of my SO bringing home the mix made a massive impact on our daughter and made the confrontation worth while to my SO.
