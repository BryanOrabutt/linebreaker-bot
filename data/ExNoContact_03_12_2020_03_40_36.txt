To be completely fair, the guys kind of an asshole. He literally constantly judges people off of their appearance, he constantly checks himself out in the mirror (especially after working out) and has literally made me watch videos titled “The science behind getting an attractive girlfriend” after I told him looks don’t mean everything. He acts like an asshole around his roommates/friends who we’re hanging out with 80% of the time. He literally set up one of his friends to walk in on me in my underwear when he said he was gonna go talk to him for a second and then sent his friend back to his room to come get me when knew I wasn’t dressed. I have small boobs and apparently one of his roommates girlfriends do too and they sat around talking about how great she would look if she would just get a boob job, which was talked about on and off for probably about 4 hours. I’m trying to hard to look at the good things about this guy, that he’s smart and funny and his friends are nice to me (atleast when I’m around) and that he does sweet things for me, like cook for me or leave me notes in my bag to find later. I feel like the bad outweighs the good and the entire time I just wish that I was still dating my ex and I just think about messaging him 80% of the time I’m with this guy but I know there’s no point so I just tell myself atleast he’s something to help me not think about him so much. I compare the sex to me and my ex’s, which used to be phenomenal, especially compared to how it is with me and the guy I’m seeing. I compare him in every aspect and I’m just starting to really only see the bad in him and only good things in my ex, but I’m afraid of breaking things off because I’m afraid I’ll regret it, or get so lonely that I do message my ex and make an idiot out of myself. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or if I’m just ranting, but any opinions are welcome and appreciated. Thanks to anyone who reads it
