Last week I told my parents my therapist was thinking they might be leaning toward a bipolar diagnosis for me. Because I was thinking about medicine, I let my parents know since I’m on their insurance.They must have panicked, they know I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety and I’ve tried medicine before - this time they told me that my uncle had sexually abused me when I was 8, and he was convicted of it. (They told me “so the doctor was sure about the diagnosis”) I have no memory of anything surrounding the event. I did know my uncle went to jail and I did know why apart from the part about me. I even knew he was convicted of touching a child I just didn’t know that child was me. Apparently counselors came and talked to me and everything to get testimony but I denied anything happening and now I don’t even remember people talking to me or my parents asking anything. Just everything is gone. Some family members still don’t believe what my uncle did to me, as in they believe everything else he did but not the thing about me. Sometimes I feel sure something happened and other times I feel so disconnected I’m not sure. It is pretty clear from what I went through growing up that something happened though, because I can name all the weird nervous habits and other things that had no reason to be happening other than something like this. My parents showed me the legal documents which included a conversation my uncle had with another person online detailing an encounter with me and it was pretty bad. It felt like I wasn’t reading about myself, apart from one line, which I can’t tell if it is me trying to remember or what. It kills me knowing my parents have read that, and that everyone knew what happened to me and just pretended my entire life that I was fine. No one sent me to therapy or anything. I feel like I can’t trust my family anymore, especially if they don’t even believe what happened to me. I feel like I’m distanced from my parents because they have been handling it kind of badly and I don’t feel like I can talk about it with them. I tried explaining I needed space and my dad ranted to me about feel guilty and that I didn’t understand even though at that point it had only been a day since they told me and I was still really in shock and he basically was saying I was selfish for not wanting to see them this weekend and it was just horrible. I’ve been so emotionally numb this week. I’m in college, in a very critical time of the school year and I have to look for jobs and do all these things and my parents just dropped this on me like they expected I’d still be able to just move on right away. Just yesterday my mom asked me how my projects were coming along. I haven’t even been able to work on anything. I feel so empty every single day. I saw my therapist this week and told her but I didn’t really feel better after talking Bantu it. Nothing it making me feel better about it. Honestly my greatest concern is that I’ve made my parents sad and that I’m really struggling to met deadlines. I only went to one class last week. When I’m in public I dissociate like crazy and I panic and I have to leave. Nothing feels okay and I don’t know how to get my work done. I also had always been suspicious that my uncle did something to me because I had one hazy memory where I just remember feeling very uncomfortable around him and I was very young, and I know he used to spank me and my mom yelled at him for it. Part of me is glad I know now because in therapy it always felt like we were missing something and this was it. But at the same time why now. This is the most critical time of my life where I finally was feeling ready to just take life by the horn and become independent and start my career and I felt passionate about my projects but now I feel nothing and I just feel lost and I don’t know why I’m doing any of this or why I want to continue living if it’s never gotten better. sometimes I self harm and this week I haven’t even had the desire to do that. I just feel suicidal but with no actual desire to do anything about it. I just want this nightmare to end and I feel so guilty that it’s been a week and I can’t move on over something I don’t even remember happening.📷**ReplyForward**
