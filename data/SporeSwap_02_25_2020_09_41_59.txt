***üî¨ Fresh Golden Teacher, B+, Mexi-cube, and Cambodian spore syringes restocked.

I will only respond to messages, or I will direct you to messages if you send me a chat.**  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # New/Restocked item background/info  **Golden Teacher-** *P. cubensis* var. "Golden Teacher" was originally discovered as a wild strain in Georga, USA and quickly became one of, if not thee, most popular variety of *P. cubensis.* This variety is one that all collectors should have in their spore library.  **B+**\- B+ is one of the longest studied varieties of *P. cubensis* and is *extremely* beginner friendly. All collectors should have this piece of history in their collection!  **Mexi-cube-** The origins of Mexi-cube are not 100% known; however, the original specimen was collected in Mexico. Interesting strain with wider than average gills that gives a distinct spore print.  **Cambodian**\- A very *beginner* friendly strain- Taken directly from Rose's Advanced Strain Guide from shroomery:  "Rumors of Cambos potency and aggressive colonization abound. Cambos are quite popular among many cultivators. According to Ryche Hawk Cambos are, "*A very nice and fast growing cubensis from Cambodia. This cubensis was originally picked by John Allen while in Cambodia filming some of the psilocybe mushrooms that grow naturally throughout a lot of the country."* "  **Here is a link to the actual spore solution these batches came from:**  [https://imgur.com/gallery/Y4PJhYO](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y4PJhYO)  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE ME AND HINT THAT YOU PLAN TO CULTIVATE ACTIVES AS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE YOUR ORDER- ACTIVE SPORES ARE MICROSCOPY PURPOSES ONLY.

Syringes are $12 for 1, $20 for 2, $25 for 3, $40 for 5 ($30 for 5 vendor's choice or $35 for 3 customer choice and 2 vendor's choice), $70 for 10 ($60 for 10 vendor's choice or $65 for 6 customer choice and 4 vendors choice) and comes with 2-4 day shipping and tracking. Order any number you want, add $7 for each additional syringe. Orders over 10 syringes will have an additional $3 charge to cover priority flat rate shipping unless otherwise indicated. I offer deals on 25+ syringes with free shipping.  **Note-** My spore syringes are made by first homogenizing the spore solution for 1+ hours with a magnetic stir bar before loading into syringes. As such, spore clumps are broken up and spores are suspended in solution. I provide a link to a video of the spore solution before loading into syringes. As spores are microscopic, this may cause the syringes to appear mostly clear. Give them a hard shake and most syringes will have a few small visible spore clumps; however, the solution will have a light purple tint to it due to all the spores suspended in solution.  Here is a post that further explains an demonstrates the process: [Spore Homogenizing Video](https://www.reddit.com/r/sporetraders/comments/eq7t79/homogenizing_video_to_help_the_community/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  ***P. cubensis syringes:***  "RustyWhyte"- > 10 left  "Cambodian Gold"- >10 left  "Golden Teacher"- >10 left  "B+"- >10 left  "PE6"- >10 left  "South American"- >10 left  "F+"- >10 Left  "Fiji"- >10 Left  "Mexican Dutch King"- >10 left- *This is the final batch of MDK I plan to have in the foreseeable future.
