They both seem like really good options but im not sure which one is best suited for me...                                     I currently own a Razer Mamba Wireless and use palm grip. Ive been looking for a lightweight wireless mouse for a while now and havent been able to find the perfect one. the razer viper ultimate seems like a good choice but i dont think i would be able to palm grip it comfortably. On the other hand though the Pwnge gaming mouse seems like it would be perfect for me because it is lightweight, made for palm grip and has the shape of a zowie EC2-A. My only concern though is that i have never even heard of this company until now. but i do know about razer and really love there gaming products. The sensor that the pwnge gaming mouse uses is the pixart pmw 3335 optical sensor. i wasnt able to find anything negative about this sensor but im still somewhat unsure.
