So. Long story short. I’m dealing with a lot of mixed emotions. Me and my gf of 4 years recently broke up about 6 months ago.. it was toxic, very bad relationship at the end. In the beginning of course it was great, but over time as more hurt occurred on both sides of the fence the further we drifted apart. We are 5 years different in age, she has a kid. I don’t have any kids, I’m 25, just got my own place, have a wonderful job, and things are getting better for me. Yes I lived with her while we dated btw.. we broke up millions of times tried to work it out, got back together, I would move back in, then next thing you know I’m moving back out. A vicious cycle... when we broke Up this last time it was for good, I moved out like I said, and tried my best to never look back I knew it was for the best... she tried to contact me a few times, most were just lashes out at me, and most recently I got a “Hey” late night Saturday text. I have not responded to a single message. I thought I would move on and never look back, I’ve done good but here recently I have just not been able to get her off my mind. I love her with all my heart, I miss her, I want to talk to her but I tell myself it’s not what I need to do. I fight the urge every single damn day. I have no idea what is going on in her life. If she’s seeing someone, nothing. I blocked her on everything. All social media... the list goes on about all the shit me and her have went thru, but man I’m struggling. I just want some advice people on what you would advise? What do I do. I have no idea how she feels. Hell she may be moved on seeing somebody by now. I have literally no idea. Just a thought for today. I’ve been on numerous dates, I have my social life back, with her she was very jealous and didn’t like me doing all that. But even after all the dates I still think about her.. anyways. I appreciate any advice y’all. Thanks
