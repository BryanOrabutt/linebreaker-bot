Okay so this morning I started off pretty well, I had a nice breakfast and was palnning on doing some stuff today, then my mother woke up. She immediately started going on about how my sleep schedule is a mess and I need to do more around the house, I was okay with this because she does this daily so it's fine by me if she wants to let off some steam, I just give her a blank stare the entire time so I don't argure or cry. She then decides to escalate it by raising her voice to screaming point and hitting my wooden bedframe with a spoon as to remind me that she's willing to hit me. She walks away and a few minutes later the neighbor comes by. I overheard their conversation and he was basically just politely asking my mother to keep it down and asked if everything was okay. My mother put on her fake kind personality and proceeded to say awful stuff about me and apologize for making so much noise. After their conversation she comes back to my room to lie to me and tell me that he was complaining that I make so much noise at night. I blankly stare at her again until she leaves. I then let her know I'm going for a  shower and if she needs to use the restroom she should, she then yells at me to not lock the door incase she has to go and I tell her I'm going to anyways because it makes me feel uncomfortable not to. As I'm undressing she slams her fist into the door causing me to scream because it scared the shit out of me. She yells at me for screaming but I just go on with what I'm doing. 5 minutes into my shower I get screamed at because she needs to use the restroom, I quickly get out and partially dressed. Once she's done in the restrooom I get screamed at for being rude, inconsiderate, entitled and much more. I feel sick, I feel tired, I'm incredibly depressed. I feel like I have 0 privacy, I can't even have a 10 minute shower anymore. I just needed to rant because this morning has been pretty shit. Sorry if this is long or sounds whiny.
