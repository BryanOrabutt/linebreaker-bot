I was cheated on ALOT in my past and obviously this does bring certain issues along going forward. Today my boyfriend (gamer) added a girl on Xbox. A random girl he doesn’t know and she was messaging him asking why he added her etc and he told me it was “by mistake” even though an hour before she had messaged asking him why he added her he was telling me she was a guy he was playing with earlier a friend of a friend. He’s decided to start a cdl league which is a bunch of players who join together and do tournaments and I’m concerned that he’s going to be now communicating with this girl using that as his purpose but it goes deeper. This could be such a dumb thing but I’m struggling to get past it. (I’m a gamer girl and not grouping all girls but ALOT of girls are on for attention and this girl was clearly flirting with him in messages when asking why he added etc adding emojis etc) Is this a red flag? Is this me being over paranoid? I really don’t know. My ex was always “accidentally”adding girls on social media etc all the time and it turned out he was cheating. Now the reason I’m struggling is the fact my boyfriend spends ALL and I mean all of his time on the Xbox, Xbox IS his social media it is his snapchat/Facebook/instagram. He locks himself away in a room doesn’t really like me coming in and from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed EVERY DAY he is on there. So this would give him opportunity to talk to other girls without my knowledge as on Xbox you can be in a party essentially like a phone call with another person or multiple people with no trace at all if you’re appearing offline. He told me I’m being unreasonable but it just feels off and it’s a trigger for me. Am I being unfair for something so small? I don’t want to get burned twice and refuse to play dumb and ignore the red flags again. Please feel free to tell me if I am in the wrong because I genuinely don’t know.
