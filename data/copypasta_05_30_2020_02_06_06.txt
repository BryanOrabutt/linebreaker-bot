 Ok just shut Its 9:30 and I'm sitting on my sofa crying because I'm fairly certain I've lost people I've considered friends. Before I talk about all of this I just want to say that things change and it's not bad or good and the is always a solution and there is never a 100% victory for everyone in conflict. In this giant message I am sending I will give all my thoughts on the matter from the beginning, why I am the way I am and why I want to change who I am in the future. Part 1: My thought on the conflict of our group in the past. Jake and I have never had the best relationship with each other, unlike jony logan max and others. I was not the nicest to jake and he wasnt the nicest to me but I would still definently call us friends in 8th grade. I think everyone enjoyed having jake around even if he could be annoying and I was happy to be invited to the group. I think the most fun I had as a group was right when I joined and I convinced jake to let logan join and we were having fun in the cafeteria and at sleepover and such. I find that during those times we were just a group, no leader and no one to pick on.  When the group died down I didnt even realize, was just caught up with life, and when Jake reformed us and restarted us he did that and I have to thank him for not letting all of our friendship be lost. When he made the new group chat he did 2 things. He Didnt add max and said as one of the first 5 messages on the group chat I didnt add max because I think no one really wants him. This leads 2 the second thing he did. He made a decision for the rest of us and restarted us making him kind of a undetermined leader. He owned the server and he called the shots. He did the organizing and he hosted sleepovers. Now this point can be argued: jake didnt make the disision to exclude max. I do partially agree with this because we could've said no or we couldve said hey but we didnt and it isnt exactly easy to unsend messages or make a new gc
