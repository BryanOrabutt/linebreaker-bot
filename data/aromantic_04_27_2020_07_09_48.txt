Ok so I’ve known I was probably Ace and Aro since around the end of my high school freshman year, but it didn’t really affect my life at all since my close friends rarely talked about their sexuality or crushes and no guys (or girls for that matter) had ever shown interest in me. I used to have worse self confidence issues and just assumed I was too ugly for anyone, but now I recognize my worth and have way more confidence! My junior year was the first year I really went all out for homecoming. I borrowed my friends dress and went over to her house to do makeup, nails, and hair and was really feeling myself. Everything was going great. I didn’t see anyone looking at me in a romantic way, but being aro makes it really hard for me to notice clues until they’re right up in my face. I was dancing with my crew when a guy came up to me and asked me if I wanted to dance with him. Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect” had just started playing and I was feeling ballsy so I stepped out of my comfort zone and told him I would. I figured this kid must have his stuff together and have really thought through what he wanted out of this dance, and I was not about to crush this guy’s dreams by telling him no and robbing myself  of my one chance of being a “normal girl” and dance with a guy. I barely knew this guy. Sometimes we would say hi in the hallway and I would only talk to him if we were in the same class and I didn’t really know anyone else, so I thought “what could possibly go wrong??” We walked towards the center of the room where all the other couples were dancing and I stuck my arms out so he could do whatever he planned on doing and he just...awkwardly placed his arms on top of mine. Oh my God was that one of the most awkward experiences I’ve ever had. I expected him to put an arm on my shoulder and move into place so that my arm was on his hip or something, but he must have been to nervous and just mimicked what I did. He told me I was really pretty and we just swayed back and forth, our arms just kinda laying on top of each other as I sung the song and he smiled awkwardly and stared at me. I am so glad I knew the lyrics because I don’t know what I would have done for two minutes if I didn’t have something to do. That was the moment I truly realized “oh shoot I really am aromantic,” since this guy was obviously nervous around me and I felt nothing. I wasn’t nervous, I just accepted the weird situation as an experience I could write about in a reddit post and then move on with my life afterward. My relationship was totally ruined with him after that, and I felt uncomfortable looking at him or talking to him since he might now be looking at me with love instead of just to be nice. I felt so uncomfortable around him, and even though I did my best not to let that show, I think he thinks he did something wrong and is now super embarrassed around me. Even though I kinda want to tell him “hey I literally don’t feel romantic feelings, so don’t worry fam,” we weren’t really good friends to start with, and I don’t really want to be friends with him now that I know he could maybe still have romantic feelings for me even if he told me he didn’t. Why does being aromantic make things that should be very simple awkward and complicated? Maybe I’ll tell him right before we graduate next year just to get that off my chest and make myself feel better, but I don’t think I really care enough about him to do that, so who knows 🤷‍♀️
