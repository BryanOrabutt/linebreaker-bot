To put simply it is the best way to maximize profit because crates and lucky draws even though they cost a lot in my currency almost a 1k some people will still buy it such as the youtubers who want to showcase the items in said crates or luckydraws and not just youtubers but the whales in the game in general, because these people exist said way of monetization continues, lets divide the players into 4 categories the f2p=0dollars, only the battlepass=5-10dollars, a few crates here and there=100dollars, everything=3000-8000dollars these are assumptions and in each category there are many people. f2p will never become a spender because they don't think 5dollars into a game is worth it, battlepass only will spend more if a direct purchase(bundles) is put into the game, Crate here and there will never open a crate again if direct purchase(bundles) is added, however for whales lets say that both ways of monetization are implamanted into the game direct purchase and gambling whales will just buy everything so i suggest tencent to keep the crates and lucky draws for those whales to give you a lot of money while adding the bundles or direct purchase to get more money in the long run from the battlepass only and crates here and there whilst maintaining the profit or even increasing it. even I a battlepass only still pull the lucky draw at least two times because the price is justifiable there and i think many are the same as me  that is why I definitely believe that you should add both ways of monetization however the contents in the crates must differ but have equal value i gurantee this is how your gonna maximize profit whilst maintaining good community feedback. you said that you'll be testing this month, test this bundles, plus crates, plus lucky draws in regards to other things the credit store is spectacular amazing job on you guys, we'll be waiting for the rerelease of zombies, game needs better hacking detection systems update it, weopon balances lets just say you guys should hire hawksnest to make all weopons equal in a way no meta(asm10), battlepass is beautiful, maps are great, BR is still cool, the ranked rewards are amazing, the extra mp or br modes are fun aswell, and the grindable stuff keep adding them I love em because getting the common hvk or common kn44 and all common guns is sign that im a player who plays the game its like having the diamond skin for me
