I was 7 and me and my family constantly moved from house to house down near the coast of southern Florida I lived with my mom dad and two sisters in this pretty shitty house if I'm gonna be honest and it already kinda creeped me out just because it was old but something weird started happening to me and to this day I can't tell if I was dreaming or not but at the same time every night for about a month I would "wake up" and look at my alarm clock the time was always between 2:30 and I clearly remember 2:58 being the latest time I woke up to what has freaked me out to this day at this house there was one hallway and down that hallway was the bathroom and two rooms the bathroom is what you would come across first but at the end of the hallway was mine and my sisters room but just before that you could turn right and there would be my parents room, outside our room I would hear someone knocking on my parents door and in a soft quite voice I would hear them asking "hello? Is anyone there? Please open up, hello?" Repeated over and over again and the words hit me like a truck and struck way to much fear into me then I feel like it should have I would check my sister's bed before throwing myself under my covers and eventually falling back asleep with those words never stopping till I fell asleep it felt like and this went on for about a month until one day I woke up and my clock said 2:58 I heard the knocking start up and the voice started again but this time I stood up out of my bed and walked up to my sister's bed to see them both asleep for sure then I walked to my door and just stared at it for a minute the voice stayed the same and never got louder even though I was at the door I don't know if I got sick of the voice or if I ate something earlier that day and was feeling a bit brave because of it but I with no hesitation threw open the door and saw a tall figure all black like a shadow the image of it that burned into my memory is it's head and eyes it's head was large and round kind of like how aliens are portrayed (I'm very certain this wasn't an alien though) and it's eyes very small beady eyes that were red that instantly locked onto me as I threw the door open the fear I felt that day, dream or not I have never experienced again and after that day that I basically confronted it has never happened again but I do tell the story every now and then as my own haunting experience #unusanus
