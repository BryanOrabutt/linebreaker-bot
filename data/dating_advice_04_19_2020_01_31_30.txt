So back when my ex boyfriend and I were together, we would always get into arguments, usually because of something I did or said. So about 13 months into our relationship it got really bad. We would argue almost everyday and it would last the whole day. We’d be lucky if we didn’t argue for a day. Our anniversary was in august, and in the end of September I guess he got me pregnant but we didn’t know until early November. When we found out I was at the hospital with my mom and I called him balling my eyes out and he spent 20 minutes trying to convince me to get an abortion. When I told him no and I couldn’t do it he said he wasn’t ready to have a child. (I am 16, and he’s 20- long story) I told him that doesn’t matter because I wouldn’t be able to live with having an abortion, and he didn’t want me to keep it, but he’d support my decision while still trying to get me to get an abortion. While he was in the middle of a sentence talking about abortion, I yelled at him, “I thought you would support me” while sobbing because it broke my heart that he didn’t want to keep it. He then paused for a minute and then disappointedly said yes, and went silent. I told him I’d call him back and I spent the next 2 hours balling my eyes out because of how he reacted. -before this all happened we were using protection, but we ran out and I told him I didn’t want to do anything without it, but he insisted that we would be okay, and with him being my first I didn’t really like it, but he refused to go back to the store to get more, so after a while he just kept pushing it on me so I finally agreed. He never got more even though we had a pregnancy scare before- he called me back and he said that he had been thinking and he said he would be excited to start a family with me. His tone of voice changed so I didn’t really think he meant it. After that I never really showed him the same affection or perkiness I guess you could say, because I was just preparing myself for him to leave me. I finally got home and I am a mess, I have been crying all day and my father was so pissed he wanted me to get rid of it. My mother and I told him that wasn’t going to happen. When we got home my dad started yelling at me, of course I understood because he is not at all a fan of my ex, and the fact that he got me pregnant as a 16 year old I was on dads side. I let him yell at me while defending myself as I saw reasonable. I went to talk to my ex and he didn’t seem too excited but he hugged me and said everything was going to be okay. Days passed and the idea sunk in and I really felt it. I wasn’t happy but I wasn’t sad at the same time. I just didn’t know what to do. I would wake up every morning and have to call out of school because my morning sickness was so bad I could t wake up before 8 or else I would throw up everything in my stomach and then some. My ex would expect me to be able to walk half a mile down the street as early as the day started to go to his house knowing I felt this way, and when I didn’t he would get pissed and say that I wouldn’t care about him. So I would gather up the strength and walk down and spend the day with him. He never had food with him or at his house so I would be too weak and sick to do anything and I could tell he didn’t like it but I couldn’t do anything to care enough. I had a job at the time and I worked second shift at a restaurant- 4-9 pm every other day. I was getting paid minimum wage and he expected me to pay for all of his needs (food, weed, cigarettes etc.) because he had to pay rent. (His rent was $450 biweekly and he got paid $600 biweekly and spent the rest of his money on weed) I would give him a little bit of money and ask him to go to the store to get me some things, and he would get things that he wanted and claim that he “forgot what I wanted” and so I would send his friends b cause I felt absolutely awful, and I felt bad for sending them so I let them get a snack for themselves or a drink or something for the trouble, and my ex didn’t like that. Fast forward about two months, I went to Maine to visit my family who I haven’t seen in a couple of years (I live in southern NH) and he didn’t want me to go because he would miss me, but I told him he can live a weekend without seeing me. I left for Maine and spent time with my family. We came back after the weekend and I say hi to my ex, and we talked for a little bit, but I headed back home to get settled in. (It was right after Christmas so we came home with quite a few things) and I went to bed. The next day I was hanging out with a friend and they told me that my ex had another girl over when I was gone, and it was a girl that he liked before we got together but still kind of had feelings for. I thought it was weird that he waited until I was gone to hang out with her, so I asked him about it and he got really defensive saying that she was his best friend so I couldn’t tell him that he can’t hang out with her (meanwhile I can’t talk to two of my closest friends because he doesn’t like them- he was very controlling) so I brought that up and he freaked out so bad that he had to leave and while he was gone he freaked out at the friend that told me about them and told him that he’s no good pretty much, and came back and didn’t talk to me. I didn’t like it so I decided that I was going to hang out with one of the friends that he didn’t let me talk to and when he found out, he screamed at me saying I went behind his back and I was acting all shady and I never did anything he wanted (yes I agree it wasn’t the best choice but I really missed that friend and he’s asexual so it’s not like anything would have happened, and I’m not that kind of girl to cheat so he had nothing to worry about) and he was screaming about how I was just a terrible person trying to make me feel terrible about myself, and if I tried to say anything to defend myself I would be the scum of the earth, so I eventually just let him yell at me and I would just take it in. (He was in Nashua at the time staying with his mom and decided to come home in the middle of the night because he was so pissed and needed to talk to me in person) ((I’m also leaving some things out but they’re the not as important things and would make the story much longer than it needs to be)) he called me a million times throughout the night while I was trying to sleep and I would decline the call and attempt to text him but he kept calling so much that I couldn’t write the sentence down so I just turned off the phone because I couldn’t deal with that stress. Two or so days later We got into a really bad argument and he was screaming at me so much that I started balling my eyes out uncontrollably and my mom took my phone and texted my friend and told him to pick me up because I needed a break from everything so he immediately came to pick me up and we went to the friends house that I wasn’t allowed to go to, and that was the fateful day I broke up with my ex. He tried calling me and yelling at me asking me where I was and I told him I was at that friends house and he started to yell at me so I put the phone on speaker so everyone could hear what I had to deal with (I always did this because I knew that not everyone was like this) and I told him that I wanted to break up. He went quiet for a minute and asked me what I meant and I told him I didn’t want to be with him anymore because I wasn’t happy. He told me that I didn’t know what I was talking about and I was just saying that because my hormones were out of control due to being pregnant, and I told him that I knew what I wanted and I told him I didn’t want to be with him anymore and I hung up. He didn’t like that so he kept trying to call me and I kept declining it, and about every 5 seconds I would get a new call from him and every time I immediately declined it. He kept doing this for two hours and I finally answered and he asked me why I did this and I told him I wasn’t happy and he was trying to ask me to come back and I said no, and he said that if i didn’t want to be with him anymore than to say it, and so I said I didn’t want to be with him anymore and he finally accepted it and ended the call and I was finally free. I could do what I wanted, I could wear what I wanted, I could talk to who I wanted, I was a free pregnant lady. But that’s not all. After we broke up he still wanted to go to appointments for the baby and stuff, and he wanted to talk in person one time and he tried to hug me and I stepped away and he kept trying to get a hug from me so I had to yell at him saying that I didn’t want to touch him to get him to stop. And he blamed me for getting pregnant and so on. I also found out that he cheated on me during the entire relationship with different people and it hurt a lot but I was thankful that I wasn’t with him anymore. Currently I do not talk to him and my life has been amazing. I have an amazing boyfriend who is very supportive and we have been planning for my pregnancy to end as I am currently in week 28 (6month mark) and awaiting the arrival of my baby boy ✌🏻✌🏻
