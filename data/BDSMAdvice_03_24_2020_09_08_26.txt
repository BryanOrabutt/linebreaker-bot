This might sound stupid or whatever but I feel pretty crappy right now and I just need some outside input to help me sort my feelings out. So my Dom has started working from home and I know it's not easy for him. I try my best to help him in any way I can. I'm always available 24/7 now because my college is shut and I'm doing remote learning so I can plan out my day however I want. He can even call me when I'm sleeping and I will wake up and serve him. I'm trying so hard to be good because I know he's going through a tough time. But I feel like he's not thinking of me much anymore. It's been a while since he asked me how I'm doing. Most of our conversations are just him giving me orders and doing whatever he wants to do. It wouldn't be fair to say he doesn't care about me because I know he loves me and he does want me to be happy but it's just that he's not able to show that right now. I don't want to seem needy but I'm not sure how much longer I can take this. Yesterday he made me cry because I forgot to complete a task for him and he just scolded me for so long. Bringing up all of my past failures and telling me how disappointed he feels. I know it's just how he copes with his own frustrations and I want to be able to help him in that way by letting him take things out on me but it's so hard. Especially because the things he says aren't wrong. He just wouldn't normally have said those things. But he's still right. I'm not the best sub but I try to do my best always and he makes me feel so worthless when he goes off on one of his rants. I don't want to sound ungrateful since he does so much for me and he's the reason I still have a place to stay but I want him to be nicer to me during this time since this is also really difficult for me. I know it's difficult for him but he's not the only one who's struggling so I feel like he should be supporting me too. What should I do?
