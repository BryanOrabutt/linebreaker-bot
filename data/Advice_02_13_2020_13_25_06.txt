So I’ve (F19) been having issues with over eating all my life and 3 years ago I lose 20 pound and I felt great and looked good but I gained it back a a few month ago and I feel awful i gained 15 pound and it’s not stopping. It started with going on the pill for birth control to help my hormones but I made it worse so I stopped it juts last week. But I’m under so much stress I feel awful, I even think my boyfriend (19) is staring to look at me and see my weight. It’s not his fault, he’s been so amazing and we both hit downs but he’s doing better and I’m not. I’m dealing with so much stress at home, I lost my retail job which made me cry ever night for a year now but after two weeks I found another amazing job and it’s still stressful because I’m learning still, it’s a regular adult job as a medical receptionist in a very prestigious doctors office. Then I’m a full time student, half online and two night a week for 2-3 hours I have class. And tomorrow I’m getting my wisdom teeth taken out. On top of a few other health issues, nothing crazy. But it’s all piling on and I can’t stop being so down and eating and hiding eating now. It’s crazy. After my wisdom teeth I’ve decided that I’m going to stop over eating and the pain will be a great help cuz I’m super sensitive so I know I’ll only be able to eat small portions of soft foods. But I’m scared it’ll make me more depressed. I’ve ever seen anyone to talk to anyone, I don’t have time and now I’m switching insurances, but also my mom is against it all, we grew up in Europe I came here when I was 7. If anyone has advice for how to change my mind set I would appreciate it. I know it would make my life at home and work easier as I’ll be less stressed. My boyfriend and I have a great life, we complain a lot about stuff but we’re still learning life and how to cope with issues, so I don’t want this to interfere with out sex life (it has not yet) but I also want to feel sexy and better and not be over weight. Thanks!
