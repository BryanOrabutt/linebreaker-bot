So crazy I took a nap and In this dream I was laying in bed smoked 2 bowls and laid down put something on the tv and than all these vibrations started happening in my vision, it was like the whole world was vibrating and during that I started to see Hallucinations, like I remember just seeing little things but I couldn’t really see them because of how intense the vibrating was. The whole time I thought it was real and I was like over dosing on something, like I would think what is going on, am I going to die ? It went away and I thought what just happened and I hoped it didn’t happen again but it came back and I was trying to go on my phone to call my mom but I couldn’t because it was too hard to see the screen and I was freaking out trying to make it stop getting mad and yelling, but it goes away eventually . Somehow I got in the bathroom laying on the ground with my vision getting darker and darker and I was saying to myself don’t let it get pitch black because once it dose you’ll be dead and than it just went away. This part is weird Idk if I had a false awakening but I remember everything felt normal no vibrating or anything and Idk remember what happened for me to get here but I was walking into my laundry room and there was a dead dangled up deer on the washer and I looked at it and was like wtf but for some reason I didn’t think it was that weird even tho it all felt like it was real, I went upstairs and my dad tells me something and now I have drive somewhere, I remember thinking in the dream oh no what if that happens driving, ( I forgot to say but with the vibrations and seeing things it would sometimes make me just lose control of my body and it would shut down but I could get control of my body fast again.)than i end up at some construction zone where they are taking down an abandoned building and I’m just in there on a scooter riding around The building. than I just wake up in real life thinking wtf was that dream. I’ve had a dream like this before with the vibrating happening but these super weird dreams only happen when I take naps not every nap, only some naps it happens
