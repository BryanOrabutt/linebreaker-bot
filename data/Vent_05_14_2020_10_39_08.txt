Currently 3 am, So let me start from the beginning, I want you’re guys’ honest opinion on what i should do, There’s this girl in my school, that i have for 2 classes, we started talking as friends, because i had a girlfriend at the time, fast forward a couple months me and my then girlfriend broke up, and i decided to invite this girl (let’s call her Savannah) to a party, she comes to the party and i hang out with her, after a while we start to yk mess around with each other, and that was it we went back to school as if nothing happened, well after a while i started to catch feelings for this girl, and i texted her and we would flirt with each other through text, then she would leave me on opened, until a few weeks later, i would make up an excuse like, “hey have you done the homework” to start texting her and we would text a lot, it didn’t take too long for us to flirt again, and that’s when we started to text all day everyday. After a while of texting 24/7 i asked her if she wanted to come to the movies with me, and so we went to the movies together :) Then a couple weeks later I invited her to my house, (btw i still live with my parents) so one day that i was home alone, she came to my house and, yk we messed around, and she slept over.. fast forward a week later and i had her over again. Now this is when i started to really catch feelings for her, me and her went late to class, to make out where no one would see us, she didn’t want her friends to see us. Well after this quarantine she just stopped flirting with me, and when i asked her why, she said “i just want to be friends” this left me heartbroken because i really thought she wanted to be something more with me,  we are still texting 24/7 and i’m sure friends don’t do that, i want you’re guys’ honest opinion, is this a L for me, or can i still win her over?
