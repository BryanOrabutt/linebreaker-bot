A few weeks ago, a good friend hit me up out of nowhere telling me to kill myself, how bad of a person I am and how my partner and I need to break up because I “ruined” them and all their friendships. I was with my partner when this happened and both of us were really confused. When i replied, he said he’s sorry and that his mental illness issues got the best of him. There are millions of people out there who have mental health issues and don’t tell others to kill themselves. Anyway, people in our friend group find out and nobody cared. I ended up distancing myself from a lot of people after this because I really dont want people who condone their actions in my life. The thing is, i have been going through a reallyyyyy hard time and all of my friends know it including the person who told me to kill myself which made what they said especially fucked up. If anyone had said that to any of my friends, I’d cut them off in solidarity because i dont want someone in my life who says things like that to my friends. But thats not an ideology that any of my friends subscribe to apparently. Its been weeks and the person and I have not talked. I also really haven’t talked to any of those friends. All of our friends continue to hang out together and I dont get invited anymore. This has been really hard for me.  Recently, my partner has started hanging out with them again. I was really upset at first and still am but I cant make people think the same way as me. As much as I know I’d not do that to my friends if they were in my situation, i no longer expect that back. Now my partner is telling me I should just get over it and start hanging out with them all again. I feel really hurt by everyone at this point. And i can either just suck it up and forget about it or lose a whole friend group of people. And still see my partner hang out with them all, since he’s over being mad at the person for what they said.
