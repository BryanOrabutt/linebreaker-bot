Last night around midnight I woke up for some reason, and was wide awake. A few minutes later I noticed a dark figure in the corner of my room, by my door. It started to move and it went towards my walker I've been using for my knee, and sat down. By then it looked like a person and then it hit me. Its my grandpa. He had his cane too. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ He then got up again and was looking at my aquarium. And then started moving towards me. I closed my eyes at that point because I was legit freaked out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. About ten seconds later I felt something pinching my lower leg and when I opened my eyes again, HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. He looked right at me. I legitimately lost my shit and started crying. And actually ended up running outside. In my damn underwear, because my mom was awake and was outside. I couldn't believe what happened, and still can't right now. I've never believed in ghosts, but I know what I saw. He pinched my leg just to get my attention. I think he was trying to say goodbye too, and to let me know he's here, even now. I had to sleep in the recliner in the living room after because I just was too spooked to get back in my own bed after that.. So far almost everyone I've told says there's no way it happened but I KNOW what I saw!! I've never been one for believing ghosts are real, but after last night.. I believe, at the very least, there is a place after death, and I think he's there right now. He looked upset and I feel it may be because he doesn't understand everything? In the end of his illness, all he wanted was to be home and we couldn't bring him home because of how sick he was. I feel like I didn't do enough and it's eating me alive. Maybe he's trying to tell me it's going to be ok. Right now I don't know how to be ok.. I miss him so damn much. ðŸ˜­ðŸ’” Anyways just really annoyed that almost everyone I've told about it so far today acts like I've lost my mind. IT WAS REAL.
