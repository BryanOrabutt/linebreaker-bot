I have been struggling with depression for a year and a half now in the past my parents always wanted the house to be quiet and if I tried to talk I would get completely chewed out by them which caused me to be very quiet in school and caused a lot of bullying I was not letting it get to me but around last year the bullying got worse and my friends never even showed interest in me like I never existed and later on my cat died and started my depression  my family started to bully me a lot because I was not good at a lot of things and they always act like there better than me and deserve better my parents were becoming extreme helicopter parents and would not let me do what I wanted to do with my life I wanted to play football but they said they would not want me to because I would get injured and so I lost interest and joy in everything I did and they never let me have my door closed and when I close it they threatened to take the hinges of the door and had to track me on my phone everywhere I went and yelled at me when I deleted the app and moving into the 8th grade was a hard transition nobody talked to me or wanted to acknowledge me and I never did my work I then got a lot of lectures from my parents and teachers and later my only female friend I caught feelings for and when I asked her out she just ghosted me and stopped talking to me I stopped hanging out with my friends and started to eat way too much just to feel something other then pain every morning I would wake up just to live the same day over and over and the pressure In my back got worse and worse each day and so I tried opening up to my parents and friends but they said stop being dramatic you have a lot of possessions you are very ungrateful and I stopped talking to anyone and I havenâ€™t had a real conversation for about 3 months with anyone and it would be nice to have someone to talk to and help me end the pain
