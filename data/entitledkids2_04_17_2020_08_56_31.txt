 Alright , i've been lingering here  a bit and now i am finally going to post. As a 25 year old male, i still enjoy video games, especially games like roblox, minecraft, and csgo. However my encounter with EKs on Roblox have the most interesting so Far. If you play roblox, you will probably know the game Adopt Me. Alright I know its a good game and all, but i dont see the fun in it. But, unfortunately for me, my niece called me on discord and pestered me to play the game with her. Not wanting to be seen as a noob, i pratically bought a mansion, a bunch of pets to make sure i dont get teased by my niece ( she is only 12 but she roasts the living daylight out of me xD). So before she joined me, a EK joins the server. I was experienced in the game ( cos my nephew made me join him but i left after 30 minutes) but forgot how to lock the house, so this brat barges into into my house and says " can i have a pet for this extremely rare item?" He then tries to make me give my pet to him and i ask "what is this rare item?" He proceeds to pull out a BICYCLE. Yes he said a bicycle was rare. He probably thought i was new due to my avatar and i responded, " Please stop trying to scam me . I know for a fact that it isn't rare. " This kid then says " NO YOU NEED TO GIVE IT TO ME ! I DESERVE IT BECAUSE IT IS MY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYY!" I replied with , " that doesnt change the fact that this pet is mine." He then types, " MY DAD IS THE OWNER OF ROBLOX HE CAN GET YOU BANNED!" I have heard many kids say this as a threat so i say, "Is your dad David Bazhuki?" He was confused and typed no. I then say " thats the owner of roblox." He must have felt extremely embarrased because he stopped typing to me afterwards. I tell this to my niece once she joined in a discord call and she was laughing like a lunatic. Nothing makes me happier then my niece's laugh. I hoped yall enjoyed it
