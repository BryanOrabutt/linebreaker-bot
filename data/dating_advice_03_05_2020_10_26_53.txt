Ok so me and this girl met on Tinder.  The first date went well and we ended up hooking up.  She was really into me and told me she really liked me and even asked if she should delete her tinder.  I hesitated and it could’ve been clear that maybe I wasn’t into her as much as she was into me.  The first she kept texting me daily and I would drag to respond because she was a boring texter.  Finally one morning I said good morning and she replied with the same good morning.  I didn’t reply for 2 days and when I did reply I just asked her on a date that same day.  She said she couldn’t because she was with family.  I said how about later in the week and she replied with “definitely ☺️”.  I asked her when was she gonna be free and she didn’t respond.  I chose to not acknowledge the ignore and just made a joke the next day about something we were doing and she went along for a while texting back and forth till she stopped.  I asked her out again 2 days later for sat night and she said she had a cold and would let me know if she felt better.  Saturday comes around and no text.  She has now deleted her tinder and we haven’t texted since so my believe is she’s uninterested now, met someone be or sees me as a fuck boi for not being so responsive in the begging.  She seemed very hopeless romantic and I really liked this girl but I was playing it too cool.  So now I don’t know if I should just let it go which I really don’t want cause I do like her or send her this final message where I express to her how I feel “Hey Maria(not here real name) I thought I'd give it one last try to see if you'd like to hang out,  I really liked you and thought you were cool.  If you don't feel the same.  Just let me know so I can get moving.”  What do you guys think?
