I'm a 23 year old daughter - not to forget the oldest, in a Bengali house-hold. My relationship with my mother has never been the best and as I grow older, my resentment only grows. I feel selfish admitting this because yes, I have shelter, they've paid for my education and yes, they have financed a lot for me. Don't even get me started with a reminder that she carried me for 9 months in her womb and then had to go through the pain of labor to give birth to me. Let's not forget that my faith lies in a religions that puts mothers on a the highest pedestal. I know all of this, and the guilt kills me, yet I can never see myself reconciling a relationship with her. Well, wrong word. There' nothing to reconcile when there was no healthy relationship to begin with. I've grown up so bitter and am still so bitter about it all. I can see it affecting my long-term success and relationships. This lack of confidence and her degrading words has surely prevented me from being the best version of myself.  From a young age, it's always felt like my mother had belittled my every move and made me feel like I was incompetent in everything I did. She's compared me to so many of my former friends and I have in fact felt like I was not good enough. The option to dorm was never present for me and so I went to a college near my house and I've been home for almost 3 years since I graduated. I am in the middle of applying to med schools and I'm so afraid I'm going to get rejected...that means I have to stay home for another year. I'm absolutely determined to go get my masters if I don't get in this time around. It's not simply because I want to get away from home, but I truly think ***I need to get away from home.*** I know how much potential I have and I have always dreamed big, but dreaming big in my house is forbidden. My mother has been a huge impediment to my success. I don't want to play the blame game or make excuses but I am not happy with the person I am right now, and I think a lot of it is because I do not feel free. I'm my own person yes, but in this house I feel more unappreciated and I can really feel my mental-health taking a hit because of this. Who am I to talk about my mental-health when my mother's demeanor towards me is most likely ***a reflection of her own unresolved mental trauma.*** My Grandmother also lives with us and my mom is constantly taking hits at her saying she made her life hell and belittled here...oh, how history repeats itself? What I don't understand is, if you didn't like the feeling, why would you do it to you own daughter? I'm not sure how connected I want to be to my family after I get married. I definitely want to help provide as much as I can to make sure they settle for nothing less than luxury, but I would like to do this with as little contact as possible. She also always takes these jabs at me saying, "you don't care for your family...I don't expect you to do anything for us". This I never understood, what could make her say that? Then again, there's a lot I don't understand about her words. There's so much more words of resentment buried within me, but I'm just having a difficult time formulating the words.
